**PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TELL ME WHAT I MESSED  UP OR HOW I CAN DO BETTER**

People in the crypto space are super creative... and believe it or not - super funny!

This manifests itself it the use of *portmanteaus* (on a basic level - these are blend words)!

For example:
Breakfast + Lunch = Brunch,
Spook + Fork = Spork,
Cryptography + Currency = Cryptocurrency

**IMPORTANTLY** these are different from compound words (two words combined into one)

For Example:
Shit + coin = shitcoin (no blending going here)

So I found a found a bunch of examples of portmanteaus in the wild (read the internet)! Then I wrote a quick python script to see what portmanteaus a computer might come up with! 

Some of them are pretty funny so I hope you enjoy!
