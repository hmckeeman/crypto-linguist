I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model. 
 
Stop giving him any reputation when it comes to crypto, this guy just shilled a shitcoin and thousands of people falls for it.
Yesterday I made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about OpisHub. It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.

Then one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:

* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)
* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project
* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes

So even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:

* they use your phone's CPU for mining
* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what "scientific research" they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse
* "each transaction gives a small % to charity"
* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees
* "our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place", so it's officially a pyramid scheme
* the token (and app) will launch soon ™

Scammer 1 had also told me they "have received £3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground". If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem "sciency" but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the "initial contact", which I think is hilarious.

So again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. Stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses.
/edit: Hi /r/all. While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch "Sustainable" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

_______________________________________________________

Original post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the "now what happens" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe "this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up "just incase it moons") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still "worth" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides "he's out" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were "ground floor adopters" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of "new money" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing "Bubble", "Scam", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to "accredited investors". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in "early", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track "monetary value" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has "popped" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about "what are the motives of the person saying this to me". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to "protect" customers from "unsafe investments" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

Do me a favour instead, sub to my YouTube channel (link at top) watch my videos how to get started properly, and plant your own trees and establish food sovereignty for your family and your community, and help save the bees, save our topsoil, and sequester carbon to reverse global warming. **My goal is to get a gardener back into every home on the planet**.

I knew a guy called John. me and him had been friends for a long time, nearly 10 years i think. i got into crypto a while back and i'd obviously talk about it with him, encourage him to start as it is a great hobby to have. John claimed he was too 'busy' to invest, i.e. playing video games all day and jacking off in his uni dorm room.

However, recently, John had a change of heart. he wanted to pull himself together and thought that crypto would be the catalyst so he came to me to learn. naturally i was ecstatic, this was one of my best friends and i really enjoy teaching people things. I taught John everything i knew, how to use exchanges, how to set up a wallet, how to spot good projects, the trends of the market etc.. i spent countless hours of my personal time helping him learn basic things (he is a bit slow).

Now, i warned John to steer clear of shitcoins. i told him that although you may get lucky and get rich quick, the chance of this happening is so low and newbies like him fall victim to these scams the most. he was very off put by this and assured me he would avoid them.

A few weeks go buy and i received a very long message from John. He told me he was quitting crypto and he had lost all of his savings he put in. i was shocked, but as i read the message it became clear to me what had happened. he said a youtuber had basically shilled him a 'low market cap' coin telling him he could 50x his money in a week. Yes, John fell victim to a pump and dump.

This is where it gets worse, i replied asking why would he do this when i advised him otherwise. i got no message back, i called him a few days after and to my shock the phone would instantly hang up. John blocked me on everything, not just phone but instagram, whatsapp, facebook. i was shocked and upset, i had done nothing wrong. i asked one of our mutual friends if i could speak to John, and he told me that John wanted nothing to do with me because i had made him lose all his money,

He didnt blame himself, or even the scammy youtuber, he blamed the person who introduced him to crypto and **warned** him of scams.

It really hurts writing this knowing ive lost someone i knew for 10 years over something i didn't even do. i just tried to help.

The moral of the story is don't advise people to get into crypto, or tell them what to invest in, friends or even family, because when shit goes south the first person they will blame is you.

edit: thanks for all the advice and support guys, ive changed my mind and im no longer sad about this. its better to get rid of people like this now than in the future.
I see a lot of safemoon shills on every subreddit, youtube and Facebook. I just don't want to see more people falling for trash projects like these so please beware. The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says "they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more".

The idea of naming it "Safe" "moon" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. "I made 100x gains", "is it wrong for the little guy to make money", "i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

DYOR.
The things is, they started being bad for many things, not just crypto.

They are getting paid to scam their fans, and they are scumbags on this planet.

How many times we saw videos on youtube, tiktok or any other platform with coins or tokens that are going to skyrocket and you should get in ASAP?

How many of those same youtubers, tiktokers etc. got rich because their tehnical analysis is amazing and they share knowledge that we should be thankfull about?

They are promoting risky, or sometimes even non existent coins and tokens.

People who are just getting into crypto are sometimes listening to them, investing blindly in what they say and lose money. And later they may think that crypto is a scam, right?

As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have "clicked" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your "HODL" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on "must have" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current "climate" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is "hot" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the "hot" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even "airdrop farming" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance "dust" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an "emergency reserve".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a "bag" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one "Gem" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and "catch them all".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a "bitcoin genius teenager" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a "rug-pull"?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned "immunity to rug-pulls".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't "make it" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The "will you make it?" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.
The more NFTs I see, the more I notice most of them are either super-basic digital art or just badly drawn stuff, little more than a bunch of lines and blobs thrown out there in the hope of making some quick money.

But seriously... why should I want to spend a ton of bucks just to claim ownership of some subpar drawing even a kindergartener would be ashamed of? 

No offense to anyone being interested in NFTs, but I don't get the hype, not when this is what some people are trying to push.

But maybe it's just my impression. 

Maybe there's a ton of amazing and moving art out there and I've just been unlucky enough to bump into desperate shills, I don't know.

What's been you experience like? Let's discuss.
Jake Paul has created and shilled multiple projects like Dink Doink and Cryptozoo which eventually led to the SEC fining home almost half a million dollars. This is good in theory, the SEC is protecting investors by giving a fine to fraudsters. But if you take even one second to go over the numbers he still wins.

Jake Paul netted millions from cryptozoo alone and his coworkers made just as much. His other scam projects such as DINK DOINK was another rug pull he cashed in on. If he is profiting 6x or more than his fine it’s really no punishment whatsoever, hardly a slap on the wrist.

The only real punishment was that it hurts his reputation. But the real issue I have with this is that tells other potential scammers that they have the green light. They can go ahead and commit mass fraud because at the end of the day you just have to pay a little tax on your profits. And retail investors lose again.

The SEC can’t seem to make one right move in the crypto world but I can’t even blame them fully because of all the influencers and celebrities are the ones doing it in the first place. There needs to be massive change if not way larger fines then at least jail time and reparations.
It is as simple as that, if they had a secret method to making millions they would keep it to themselves. All of these youtube and telegram tip channels are simply pump and dump schemes where they buy into a token cheap and then shill it to their followers so that they can dump their shitcoins at a profit.

The old saying "if its too good to be true, then it isn't true" applies 99% of the time in crypto. There are a few individuals out there that do share their genuine knowledge but they are far and few between, dont get suckered into the biggest and most prolific scam in crypto!
**EDIT: read the post before you shill your sub-$1-coins, please, why does nobody do this today?**

I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:

*"what are the best coins under $X?"*

And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

So, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.

**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one.
My karma may take a hit for saying this but idc, mass adoption at ANY COST is not acceptable, we cannot sacrifice decentralization for adoption if it means giving up control to governments and institutions. ETFs are a perfect example, you thought "oh a BTC ETF it's cool because theres no option to short BTC" well a week later they can now short BTC with the second BTC ETF. Regulations are the same type of double edged sword that may help people get comfortable with adopting crypto but gives the government immense power over the market. They are playing us by giving us adoption while taking control of the whole damn thing. Wake the fuck up.

Shitcoin pumping is also a new feature here, it's your choice to do that but remember it's not good for the market to shill shitcoins. Also if a new crypto investor gets burned on a shitcoin they will probably leave the market for good so if you care about mass adoption maybe stop pumping shitcoins. But hey I don't know shit about fuck🤷‍♂️

Here's the deleted tweet where he's supporting the coin. 

[Gunna's Tweet.](https://preview.redd.it/w7el1hargff81.jpg?width=1283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b2cf746081e07bc3a9f2f0b04f2740c7777a4331)

After shilling this shitcoin he tweeted again with "I wunna C Everybody Win" which is kinda ironic since the project was a complete rug pull.

He deleted the tweet after this drop, it's sad that how big celebrities' can just run away after scamming their own fanbase. He didn't even stand up to his words for 1 day.   


Please stay away from these celebrities when it comes to taking financial advices. Kim, Floyd, SouljaBoy and Gunna none of them are your friends they are here just to make a bag by scamming their fanbase.

[EXPERIMENT – Tracking 2018 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies – FOUR YEAR REPORT – UP +34&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/dzzes3g8ngb81.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a7be57c5962d3f167620aa08e15456c30ee8a6a)

***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the FOUR YEAR REPORT for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting every single month for four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and more recently, the [2022 Top Ten a few weeks ago](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/). ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month.
* **December** **Highlights:** A bloody, all-red month
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** solidly in the lead, followed by **BTC** and **ADA.**  After briefly pulling ahead earlier in the year, ***the 2018 Top Ten are now significantly underperforming the S&P 500*** over the same time period.  Q: So, big crypto fail, right?
* A: Only if I stopped after the first year.  The **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 406%, much, much better than traditional markets over the same time period (**fancy new chart at the very bottom of the post).

***Some exciting new changes for*** [2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!***

1. I'll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)
2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 
3. Factoring in stablecoin gains:  In past years, I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year, I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit: my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year, a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).
4. Giveaways: Who doesn’t love a good old fashioned giveaway? I’ll be giving away crypto during the year, either through Twitter, Reddit, or my email list. I’m still figuring out the details, but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.
5. Friendly competition: I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.

And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Four Year Report – UP 34%

https://preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a139e422647297b558b778711c2ca3d1b01a488

Welcome to the four year report!

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least, only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos, Assembly and Shimmer).
* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead, **BTC** in second place, **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.
* After four years, the 2018 Portfolio is +34%, behind the S&P 500’s ROI over the same time period.

## December Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=51b9f8a5acf84232fa4b6f997cf200214a839a94

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin, Tether**, **DOT, SOL**, **LUNA**, and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.

## December Winners and Losers

***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack, dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.

***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value, **Litecoin** fell the most, down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC**, dropping -27% in December.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After four years, here’s a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. 

https://preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=60cdac19d82f219da3525ab7778266cc5ea3f983

With 11, **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).

**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasn’t yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).

## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper. After four years, ETH in first place, and Dash and NEM tied for worst overall performance.

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio continued to lose value.  After four years of holding these cryptos, only 3 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC,** **ETH,** and **ADA.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+413%) is well ahead of **BTC** (+257%) and third place **ADA** (+99%).

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four years ago?  It’s worth $515 today.

**DASH** and **NEM** are virtually tied at the bottom, both down over -86% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in each four ago is worth about $13 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/mldnsr7zpgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cc38383ed29a0a2ec36b9d69ec4388be2b4cfe6

End of December 2021 market cap: **$2,211,626,655,207**

The total crypto market dropped significantly in December.  Crypto as a sector is still up +285% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+34%), the return of the S&P (+78%) over the same period of time, and nine of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/qygnx0a0qgb81.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2727a5f71a265d7ab6a9454a59c0e6b1f5bb8705

**BitDom** declined a bit in December, ending the month at 40.2%.  When looking at the entire four year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/cxtd9lb1qgb81.jpg?width=339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=493ac038d25dfe29b3d5f12f1e40bd334ed0e817

The 2018 Top Ten Portfolio lost $325 in December.

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $1,341**, up 34% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

Green is unfamiliar territory for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio and a recent development.  Over the first four years of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, thirty-eight months have been in the red, with only ten months of green.  And all ten of the green months have come in 2021. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment four years ago:

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

Remember: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 in the ***2019***, ***2020,*** and ***2021*** Top Ten Cryptos as well (***(and, just announced,*** [***again in 2022***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***!)***.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-48): up +34% (total value $1,341)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36) up +504% (total value $6,044)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24): up +795% (total value $8,951)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12): up +292% (total value $3,921)

So overall? Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,257** ($1,341 + $6,044 + $8,951 + $3,921).

**That’s up +406%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**last month’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/xcl80o35qgb81.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d6ddc6d0b5fa7790a55493f890b3ec6c9190812

***That’s a +406% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for four years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/3uss07c8qgb81.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70e72c223a768b7842f0b5a82baa74371d6fd9b9

After four years: the S&P 500 is up +78% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,780 had it been redirected to the S&P.  That’s more than double the +34% return of the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio over the same period of time.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,780 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,900 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,480 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,270 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $6,430** ($1,780 + $1,900 + $1,480 + $1,270)

That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride! Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for monthly progress reports. Keep an eye out for my parallel projects where I repeat the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of new sets of Top Ten cryptos as of [January 1st, 2019](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-36), [January 1st, 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-24), [January 1st, 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-12), and most recently, [January 1st, 2022](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/).
Given the events of the past week with Doge and XRP pump and dumps it’s clear that we need to protect people within this community. Some have been in this space for a lot longer than others and there’s been plenty of examples of scams throughout the years and plenty people scammed with them. 

The Doge pump last week angered me and you could see people getting excited and the inevitable was going to happen. A lot of new people got sucked into the prospect of quick, easy money and calls for calm fell on deaf ears.

Then the same with XRP. I had friends calling me about it and asking advice and I told them exactly what I thought was going on, which transpired to be the case.  Lucky they took my advice and held off. 

There’s been a significant rise in new accounts shilling these days and it’s our responsibility to help ease new investors into the space. It’s frustrating watching the endless shill. Is there anything else that can be done to protect this space? Scamming people doesn’t bode well for the future of this society.
You also only have to buy into BTC once, unlike a 401K where most people keep buying back in every pay check only to lose what you earned in interest by paying a penalty if you withdraw too early.   Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    

It's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.

Also you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* 

What she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. 

Nowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*

Unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  

Rich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. 


So yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. 

So if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. 

So stick to your original plan, and hold.
Binance have taken a couple of big hits in recent months but their team have done an oustanding job of keeping us all informed, doing everything they can to stop FUD and just in general doing a really good job of sorting things out and being very transparent whilst doing so.

In my eyes they are one of if not the most respectable and trustworthy exchanges for cryptocurrency, I will most definitely will keep using their platform. 

Good work Binance 👌

Edit - I'm not a shill (except maybe for Ripple). I have just been really impressed with how binance have handled situations like this. It's a fresh breath of air when you look at all the other shit going down in the crypto world. Stay safe and remember even though Binance have done well so far, don't leave all your portfolio in exchanges. Hard wallets are the only safe place

Edit 2 - again I am not a shill, no one has paid me to do this. If I'm gonna get all this abuse for being a shill you may as well pay me ETH - 0x9f2e847ceebafa475aab29c56205b6c374e11ade
You might wonder why Coin Bureau doesn't play adds on their channel.

How incredibly egalitarian of them, right?

Wrong.

Coin Bureau is owned by a company called V3 Digital based out of London. Guess what V3 Digital is? Yep, a marketing firm that tries to maximize traffic for their clients.

From their website:

" Your digital marketing strategy is incomplete without content marketing, which is why getting it right is always imperative. Our marketing experts are capable of tailoring content so that it engages your target audience at every stage of their journey. "

" Growing your followers on social networks will help you increase word of mouth and referrals. We provide social media marketing services that enable you to reach relevant people, increase your following, make connections and drive organic traffic to your website with high success."

&#x200B;

Basically, the Coin Bureau channel is designed and curated to manipulate and influence your opinions on crypto for either clients of V3 digital or V3 digital itself. Essentially Coin Bureau is paid to shill the highest bidder. They want you buying their shitty hoodies and t-shirts while they cram misinformation and their agenda down your throat. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Do not trust coin bureau. Guy is a paid actor who has zero technical knowledge. Coin Bureau is owned BY V3 digital, a marketing firm out of London that shills for the highest bidder. It is an untrustworthy source of information. Know you're being manipulated. Their "mistakes" are not mistakes at all. Rather highly focused and targeted marketing with the intent to manipulate your crypto decisions.**

Guy is not the founder or creator of coinbureau. Nic Puckrin, a former investment banker from Goldman Sach's is.

Guy majored in English and is literally an actor who even acted in other roles and not someone with previous investment or technical experience. Read: https://www.coinbureau.com/who-is-guy/. At least they are honest about him being an actor.

So apparently Stan Lee released NFT collection from the dead. Stan Lee's twitter account has a tweet about an NFT collection.

This was the tweet from Stan Lee's twitter account

***From championing diversity to embracing new tech, Stan was 1 step ahead of the curve. To honor his innovative spirit, Stan's 1st Indian hero, Chakra The Invincible, debuts in his own NFT (digital art) collection from 7:30pm PT 12/27-12pm PT 12/29!***

The website is even worse 

 **Honoring what would have been Stan Lee’s 99th birthday on December 28th, we are inviting all of Stan’s fans to celebrate his amazing legacy with us by sharing ownership**

How is making money off him Honoring his legacy?

I hate to see Stan Lee being used to shill something. I mean the person is dead , they just can't let the man rest in peace. Stan Lee was my idol when I was younger and seeing this company take advantage of his name and creations is heartbreaking.
Well its happened, the crypto market just experienced the worst crash since 2014, the bubble has burst. [The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? 

In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. 

The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the "irrational exhuberance" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.

But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.

So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:

#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:

1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.

2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.

3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.

4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.

5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. 

First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.

**ROI targets**

A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. 

But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. 

You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.

**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**

Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion

Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%

This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.

**Risk Management**

Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:

* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. 

The general starting point I would recommend is: 

* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience

* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions

* Don't go all in on speculative picks.

Some more core principles on risk management to consider:

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. 

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.


You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.


**Portfolio Allocation**

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc

* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc

Think about your ["Circle of Competence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. 

You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)
------------------------------------------

Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:

# Step 1: Filtering and Research

There is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.

[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the "Enterprise" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.

Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:

* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. 

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.

* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?

* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How "shilly" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?

* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.

You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:

* allocations that give way too much to the founder

* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)

* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords

* vague timelines and no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on 

#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist

Once you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:

Crypto Analysis Checklist |
---------|
What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |
What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |
How big is the market they're targeting? |
Who is their competition and what does it do better? |
What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |
What current product exists? |
How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |
Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |
Can it be easily copied? |
What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |

The last question is the most important. 

This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:

Benefits of Cryptocurrency |
---------|
Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |
Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |
Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |
Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |
Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |
Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |
Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |
Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |


#Step 3: Create a valuation model

You don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**

This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:

1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring
2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability

Combining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.


**Metcalfe's Law**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:

For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47
Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03

Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.

**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**

Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

**More complex valuation models**

If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). 

You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.

Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.

The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.


#Summing it up
------------------------------------------

The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these. 


Edit: Also get a [crypto prediction ferret](https://i.imgur.com/ZEJqZHf.jpg). You won't regret it.
The main focus throughout the bear market was the development of the Ethereum ecosystem. That is why the most popular dApps are all currently comfortably situated on the Ethereum main network. Yes, Ethereum's price dumped during the bear market as well, but the OGs in the space and all of the developers kept their eyes laser focused on the development happening within the Ethereum ecosystem.

I personally believe there are several solid alternatives to Ethereum (Polygon, Avalanche, Solana), but unless such networks have built a bridge to Ethereum, they likely will not survive. That is why all of the chains I mentioned were forced to develop bridges to Ethereum because no developer in their right mind would leave the Ethereum ecosystem for a risky sidechain or other layer 1 network. I do not think Cardano will be any different, but this is just my opinion.

Unless someone can tell me otherwise, I am not aware of any actively used dApp that has committed to migrating from other chains to Cardano. Unless you see the likes of Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, Synthetix, USDC, and Yearn talk about migrating to Cardano, there really isn't anything to talk about with regard to "Cardano killing Ethereum". Hint: they'll never migrate.

I'm posting this because I'm getting sick of the manic Cardano threads where bagholders are desperately trying to get others to buy so the price goes higher and they can sell. Yes, they are scheduled to release smart contracts soon, but the biggest question remains, ***who is going to use their platform***? I have seen extraordinarily innovative developments being made on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and those did not happen overnight and it's hard to imagine people just packing up their bags and leaving to work on Cardano.

To all of the people about to yell at me for making another "Cardano is overhyped post" I want you to take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror: have you ever actually *used* Ethereum? Polygon? Avalanche? Solana? Have you ever actually *used* a decentralized exchange, lending protocol, NFT marketplace/game, or provided liquidity to these networks? I have. I've done all of it. So do you really have the perspective to be arguing about "Ethereum killers" and how "great" Cardano will be when you don't even have experience with engaging and interacting with smart contracts?

Where is all of your hype really coming from, the echo chambers on Twitter and Reddit? I'm asking because I fell for the same "academic scientific approach" marketing in 2017 and it's just the same cycle over and over again - Cardano is great at making money during bull markets, but not very good at delivering promised products, but I really hope I'm wrong this time.

!remindme 8 months

EDIT: Maybe some users in the comment section can look at one another and realize that there is not a single rebuttal to my points (removed technical because one user is right, I didn't really provide "technical" arguments). Every post is about price action. Will Cardano potentially make you some money this bull run? Sure, that is, if you aren't stuck holding bags while everyone sells the top. But please, let's stay on topic. Present some counterarguments related to the actual utility of the network.

EDIT 2: People should be aware that there was very similar hype surrounding Cardano leading up to the Coinbase [listing date](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-launching-on-coinbase-pro-694b1cb8c778?gi=2495f7011d1c) (March 16-18), and the hype pump peaked at 1.38 (ATH at the time) on March 17, dumped to 1.24 (-10%) by March 18, and continued to dump to 1.06 (-25%) by March 24. Sure, it kept going up, and we may see a similar "pump, dump, pump" related to the smart contract release, but the "pump" following the "dump" all depends on execution and whether people actually care to use Cardano's platform.

EDIT 3: Thanks to a great comment by u/BornToBeHwild, I learned that Cardano is already developing and supporting an Ethereum bridge ([https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/05/17/bringing-erc20-to-cardano/)), which proves my point entirely - Cardano won't "kill everything in this space", they are already building measures to integrate with the existing ecosystem and adapt, so maybe it's time to stop saying it will end all of the progress that has already been made in decentralized finance and media and take over the world.

EDIT 4: I realize that my post is very triggering and I will edit the language a bit to emphasize the points I'm trying to make and remove some of the more triggering elements. Sometimes you forget in all of the mania that people have money at stake and I by no means am trying to "FUD" Cardano. I have friends and family who own this coin and I actually like Charles as he introduced me to a lot of the concepts I learned about in this space through his videos and lectures. I hope Cardano succeeds.

The point of my post was that people need to understand there already a ton of great, functioning products out there that all promised similar "Ethereum killing" capabilities that ultimately had to adapt and integrate with Ethereum in order to remain relevant and I do not think Cardano will be any different (see EDIT 3). Just trying to set expectations, especially for newcomers who are probably feeling FOMO for Cardano and are tempted to buy it while it's up x2 it's 2017 ATH and at the peak of its bull run. I'm not saying it won't go higher, but I do think the mania can be harmful for people who are just getting into the space now.

EDIT 5: I want to bring attention to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vgije?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in this thread made by u/Bwahehe, which is not getting enough upvotes and perfectly articulates the point I am getting across:

>ETH is like Manhattan. Horribly crowded with insane traffic, but they're doing a ton of business.  
>  
>Cardano is like someone selling a potentially lucrative spot of land but absolutely no businesses are there yet. They promise that they'll finish the roads in a month or two but they'll be some damn amazing and scientifically proven roads.  
>  
>Most up and coming smart contract coins promise massive highways and roads but nobody knows if the roads and bridges are really safe to drive on and only hydrogen powered vehicles approved by them are allowed on the roads.

EDIT 6: I'm trying to respond to everyone but this is exploding... Also, I keep getting accused of "missing" Cardano or "buying it high" or something. Guys, look at my username. [I'm all about The Graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owryqy/why_the_graph_grt_also_known_as_the_google_of/) (GRT).

EDIT 7: I've been reading more and being a bit more selective about commenting back since there are just too many to keep up with and every time I refresh there's 50 more, but I'm really happy to see that the comments have shifted from price to actual discussion. Great to see! This is what r/CryptoCurrency should be all about! I like ADA, I like Charles, I want it to succeed for reasons I mentioned above.

This isn't meant to be a tribalistic war-igniting trigger post. I just think it's time to have real discussion on this sub and Cardano is the hottest topic because it is leading the bullrun in gains. Stop getting so bent out of shape, my post is not going to cause Cardano to dump, nor is it an attempt to provoke a dump. I think this is a great place for newcomers and old schoolers to join one another and discuss what they know. It's also a great opportunity for Cardano followers and supporters to counter my arguments and present their points and why they believe in the project - remember, I have not really kept up with Cardano since 2017, so I can totally be wrong about a lot of things and I accept that! The point is, this thread was a success because it reminded thousands of users here that we can still engage in high level discussions and not everything has to be about price and driving lambo rockets to the moon.

Just want to thank a few posters for their great comments including  u/orangeblack07 ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vtoat?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/todayismycheatday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vsq6t/?context=3)), u/cali_dave ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vogw9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), u/OhIamNotADoctor ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p95p41/for_those_of_you_who_werent_here_during_the_bear/h9vnxer?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). There are so many great comments, but as you can imagine, my inbox is absolutely obliterated and I need to go to sleep lol, so give these guys the upvotes they deserve!

EDIT 8: Last edit (I hope). Some great discussion ultimately ensued and I appreciate everyone who made thoughtful posts. I definitely don't appreciate the attacks on my character and assumptions about who I am as a person, but I guess that's part of making controversial posts like this. Had no idea it would blow up so much and did my best to answer as many comments as I can. I really hope everyone knows that I do like ADA, I do like Charles, and I hope Cardano succeeds (though I think I've already mentioned this in another of my 45 edits). I was just hoping to stimulate some actual discussion on a subreddit that is in dire need of it. Thanks for engaging me. Till next time!

EDIT 14: Lots of great comments actually made me realize I don't know the first thing about what is going on with Cardano at this point in time, I'm not ashamed to admit it. There's a lot more going on than I thought there was! I listed some of the good comments that pointed me in the right direction above in EDIT 6. Maybe I'm wrong about Cardano, maybe the slow and steady wins the race philosophy will prevail! Who knows. I'm just glad that there were so many newly introduced perspectives in this thread hidden between the shill and anti-graph\_marine brigading. I'll be eagerly awaiting the launch of their smart contract platform and dApps so that I can dabble with them myself.

Thanks again to everyone who provided quality discussion and also to anyone who gave me awards, you really didn't have to do that!

tl;dr (for those who want one) - Cardano has taken a very long time to release a product while others have thrived. People only seem to talk about Cardano during bull markets when the price is going up and I want to have a discussion about how people can think it is the end-all-be-all smart contract platform when it still doesn't have a working product. Discussion ensues. Some posters create great counter arguments and provoke thoughtful discussion while others brigade me with hateful spam.

Kevin O Leary just lied in front of the Senate, with the whole world watching.

Here is his testimony under oath where he said this  to the question "Why did FTX fail": https://twitter.com/Benzinga/status/1603076399593844736

Lets get this straight - he said FTX didnt fail because of fraud, laundering user deposits into personal accounts or into their own hedge fund to make risky trades, bought expensive condos with customer deposits and just ran the most incompetent bucketshop ever possible etc, but because "Binance put FTX out of business"

In stark contrast, the main bankruptcy professional and new FTX  CEO John Ray told the House yesterday that FTX collapse was the result of old fashioned fraud. He was asked if Binance caused this, he flatly said NO. 

In the testimony to House, he was asked by Rep Gonzalez (at time 2:43:30),

> Rep Gonzalez: One of the things in Mr.  Bankman-fried's testimony that has  leaked, that wasn't submitted, is he spends time  talking about Binance and how Binance  created a run on the bank, suggesting that, had that not occurred, FTX was solvent and would have been just fine.  Prior to that episode -- is it your belief that FTX  was solvent? 

> Mr. John Ray: NO


You can listen to the testimony here and forward to the time mentioned above. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ObdFaUL7nc&t=9795s

Also this entire testimony of John Ray pretty much outlines how SBF was running a fraudulent shop for months. John who has now assumed control of FTX and is in an authoritative position to tell us what went wrong at FTX quite simply states the whole enterprise was a fraud. The DoJ, SEC and CFTC have already filed charges against SBF, but here we have Kevin O'Leary telling the Senate that SBF is innocent but its Binance put FTX out of business. 

Whats really dangerous is that Kevin knows this is not true, yet goes onto Senate to state lies under oath. He has worked his entire career in finance. He knows that John Ray has the best knowledge to put together what happened at FTX. He knows investigations of multiple agencies have put the blame on SBF. Yet he goes and tries to whitewash SBF's crimes. 

Kevin O'Leary is a conman, who last week even said he would continue to do business with SBF. This week SBF got arrested, yet Kevin is still lying to the Senate. He got paid $15 M to be a shill for SBF. Its a shameful joke that he was even called up to testify in this issue. Its like inviting Ted Bundy's spokesperson to the Senate so that he can whitewash his crimes. Such actions dont make Ted Bundy or SBF look any better, but it just diminishes the respect of the Senate as an institution. 

This guy deserves to be in the same cell as SBF. Every penny paid by SBF to this fraudster must be clawed back to make FTX depositors whole.
I'm at a loss for words (well, not literally, otherwise you'd not see this post). I've been a holder since XRB days. It's my first coin. It was perfect: Instant. Feeless. Green. IMO, it was what Satoshi intended as the ultimate crypto**currency**.  

&#x200B;

Now, I understand Nano came to be in a situation where smart contracts where not such a big thing, and there were no "swaps" and there was no staking/lending/liquidity pools etc. People want more from crypto and that's OK. But I'm not OK with freakin' SHIB and SAFEMOON having a larger mcap than Nano. I'll never be OK with that. For the love of all that is holy, SAFEMOON should not be a word any of us remember in two years. 

Sure, there were two major incidents, both occurring in the bull runs, the exchange exit scam crap and the spam attacks now.  And sure, it was shilled here relentlessly. And people hate shillers. But how can a coins main fault be "it's fan base is annoying"?? 

/my incoherent rant, I'm just bummed something so technically great is not actually "appreciated" more.



**Edit**: holy amount of comments, Batman.  RIP my inbox.

Thank you everyone for the awards, there's too many of them to reply to you all individually (i still believe in thanking personally for the awards but since my inbox is MIA, this is a bit troublesome).

Also, someone was so concerned about me being bummed, a bot sent me a message about suicide hotline. While I would never do something like that over crypto (or money), I honestly appreciate the kind thought. You are (as Keanu says) breathtaking.



Take care everyone (even Safemoon holders).

**Edit 2** this has become my most upvoted post. I don't know what to say. Thank you to everyone, Nano fans and Nano haters.

Also, it seems Safemoon holders have figured out this post, so they started brigadding. Some had hilarious things to say about Nano (e.g. "Out of #100 instant and feeless" and "Nano is very fast. Out of top 100hehe"). Laughs were had. Just to clarify, if Safemoon and SHIB start doing great things, there will be no one happier than me. I still think both of them have too many red flags, but I'm happy for you if you profit. Take care now and have a good day
SHIB is grossly over valued, just like dogecoin was overvalued back in March, and everyone who called it out back then was spot on. 

Of course, the SHIB shills are peddling the narrative that it will go to $1. 

Currently, one SHIB = $0.00002715

To go to $1, it has to go up by 3,683,141%. Yes, it has to go up by 3 million %... 

To go to even 10c, it has to go up by 362,884%

Apparently, there are 394,796,000,000,000 SHIBs in circulation. 


Even at 10c, the market cap of SHIB alone will be over $39 Trillion. 

To be specific, a market cap of Thirty-Nine Trillion, Four Hundred Seventy-Nine Billion Six Hundred Million dollars

Today, the entire crypto market cap is around $2.3 Trillion. So even at 10c, SHIB will be worth 20x today's crypto market cap. 

Firstly, this is not happening anytime soon. 

Secondly, this is not happening anytime in the future either.

There is a higher probability of SHIB going to zero over it going to $1 or even 10c. 

Hundreds of shitcoins bust onto the scene during a crypto boom cycle, only to disappear during the bust. 

SHIB is a token that has no real value, apart from exploiting amateur investors and unit bias and traders riding it for quick gains. Almost everyone is in SHIB purely for profit. Many want over night riches and plan to hold till $1, which they believe will come soon.. many others are riding it got quick gains, and there is nothing wrong in that. Many shitcoins can give quick gains. But for them to claim there is something innovative or anything resembling new technology in SHIB is just delusional. 

The whole project is quite an exquisite combination of several pyramid scheme elements, and is quite well done. The devs have really delivered on their promise of making themselves rich.
I've seen a lot of posts complaining about how r/cryptocurrency only shills stagnant coins that have already pumped. And coins like SHIB, LRC, KDA, and SOL are never mentioned until after they explode. 

This is entirely by design. Your exposure to posts on reddit is a function of how many upvotes those posts have received. And the more bagholders a particular coin has, the more upvotes. Which is why the front page is a billboard for ADA, ETH, ALGO, VET, and a handful of others. By definition, the coins you repeatedly see here already have large numbers of holders. You don't get rich buying something that everyone else already owns. Hence why projects start to stagnate when they become popular. Popularity on r/cryptocurrency is actually a great indicator for when growth can be expected to taper. Cardano is perhaps a prime example. 

By contrast, posts about undiscovered projects will almost universally be buried. There may well have been a post shilling SOL at $1 or SHIB in 2020, but they never would have made it past the last page.
This is the list I wish I could find when I started out, it would have saved me a lot of money and time.

[~~Ivan on Tech~~](https://youtube.com/c/IvanonTech) The guy who brought us "[Respect da pump](https://youtu.be/4TlaEZt6YmQ)": meme, but his content is terrible

[~~BitBoyCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/channel/UCjemQfjaXAzA-95RKoy9n_g): It's rumored that he dumps his coins on his followers, he promotes risky leverage and his channel content is average at best.

[~~MMCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/c/MMCryptoTube): Same as Bitboy, just empty sensationalism to lure new comers to click on his Bybit affiliate links.

[~~The Moon~~](https://youtube.com/c/TheMoonCarl): His favorite phrase is "Exaaqctly as predicted" He buys fake comments to pretend they are making money with his calls so can get more Bybit referrals

DO NOT take any Youtuber's words as gospel, Do your own research, but those are a good start.

If your favorite Youtuber isn't here doesn't mean I hate them, you can add them in the comments

This is really blew up, thanks everyone for their contribution to this list
I’ll be reading discussions and considering my investments then you’ll see lots of comments like “I’ve got a spare $100 to throw at something, shill me” and so I suddenly realise that a lot of what gets posted is from people with very little skin in the game. I know it’s all relative and I am not meaning to sound arrogant but just yeah sometimes it surprises me when I read so many queries about such small investment amounts because people talk and act like they are talking about much larger sums.
Am I right? Or am I right? Let me just be the first one to say I am SO happy shitposting is back. Have you guys tried sorting by new? Oh my goodness the “technical analysis” I’ve seen is incredible. That leads me to ask,
is your coin of choice going up? Have you seen the triple double golden shower triangle? Well, the funny numbers only go up so you best spread the word! Be sure to tell everyone that your coin is pumping, will keep pumping, and will never stop pumping. 

Did you take the price chart and take it to art class? If you have doodled and discovered some fun shapes in the chart than you bet your ass it’s *technically* analyzed! Just take a crayon, and take a chart, you can try this at home! They’re never wrong!

This is what I’m asking of you friends, shill me your best technical analysis! Do you know shit about fuck? Are you going to shitpost in the comments, or do you know what you’re talking about?

**IS THIS FINANCIAL ADVICE?**

*This is not financial advice*

*or is it?*

Edit: spelling
*(This was my post 110 days ago which never got approved)*

Dip is 10-20% down. Don't buy it.

When it happens, Redditors will jump on you screaming *BUY THE DIP* directly to your ear. Don't buy it. You're calm, your mind is clear, you aren't fueled by emotions.

Soon it will dip 20-30%. You will notice frequent memes like

>What I thought was the dip. The dip. The actual dip. The actual dips dip.

Logically, you still don't take the bait. You play the waiting game. You are in charge here.

Next leg is minus 30-40%. Some people are borrowing money to buy here, since they spent all of their money on previous dips. Some people start questioning is this just a correction or bearmarket. You will notice posts like

>When Bitcoin was 60k you wished you bought it at 40k. Now it's below 40k buy now as you promissed!

You just smirk reading this post, take a sip of your tea, scroll down, turn on radio or something.

Next leg is minus 40-60% from ATH. Alts are massacred. You will notice that no one will even mention buying the dip, even as a joke. Even people who bought the dips are now down so much, that their stress is somehow even as the literal top buyers. People are now posting predictions of low will it go.

At this point, you start stretching. Counting your money. Calculating how much can you afford to spend on crypto. Getting prepared for the last stage.

**60-80% correction, bearmarket acceptance and capitulation phase**

Suicide hotline number is posted, and pinned by moderators. Divorce rates increase. People are selling for a loss, because they are emotionally damaged and don't want to play this game anymore. Others are just deleting apps related to crypto on their phones. Moonboys are out. Newbies are out. Sub is pretty much dead, low number of comments and posts. There isn't hope on a horizon.

This is where you start buying. You also accumulate every now or then when you can afford. You do this for next two years or whenever next rally starts. Here's how to recognize when to exit, also know as top signals:

&#x200B;

>Matt Damon calls you a (curse word) for not owning a Bitcoin

&#x200B;

>Athletes shilling you coins or NFTs

&#x200B;

>Talk show hosts changing Twitter avatars to cartoon monkeys

&#x200B;

>Katty Perry having shitcoins on her nails

&#x200B;

>Miley Cyrus giving you financial advices

&#x200B;

>Increasing numbers of Tiktok investing gurus

&#x200B;

>Onlyfans girls giving you investing tips

&#x200B;

>Youtubers giving round number predictions like 100k 500k 1mm price eoy

&#x200B;

>Talking hat showing you meme lines where number only go up till infinity

&#x200B;

>Third world countries gambling with tax payers money on crypto

&#x200B;

>Michael Saylor buying Bitcoin

&#x200B;

>Anyone telling you this time will be different

>Anyone telling you there are no bubbles in new financial paradigm

Take profits here and repeat the process. Thank me later.
I've been doing this strategy for a few months now and so far and man...it's working like a swiss watch.

Remember the hard ADA shill when it was closing on $3? Mega shills all around, ADA is best, ADA is life, buy before it goes to $5. Then it was LINK mega shill when it reached 30$. Link linking everything together and stuff like that. I still believe in LINK but with way less bullishness.Then VET, the beloved unofficial coin of this sub. It moved but mostly to the right. Or LTO which has been nose diving for a while. ERGO too. All these are super popular here and one mention against them can send you to downvote hell in a few moments.

If you think fanboyism is real in gaming subs, prepare to witness the knowledge of r/cc

Seriously, I started working exactly the opposite as the sub is saying. Shilling LTO, SELL. Shilling ADA, SELL. FUD on Solana? Buy as much as possible at $60. FUD on LRC at 1$?

Take this sub with a big pinch of salt when you come looking for advice. It's a big circlejerk and an echochamber where you really need to filter the comments out a lot in order to find good advice.
DeFi on Solana is being wiped out, so to speak. 

At the start of the month, TVL on the chain was close to $1bn. Now it has crashed to $280m and is out of top 10. 

[Top chains by TVL](https://preview.redd.it/0raskafxsy0a1.jpg?width=2756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4235463e8efe06b0c462e4fbd50f509e492694e3)

&#x200B;

[The crash has been nothing short of spectacular](https://preview.redd.it/hyzlggc1ty0a1.jpg?width=2084&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac157bef58f15ccf398a70033032d7fcfddc33d5)

At the peak of the bull run, Solana boasted close to $10 BN in TVL. Now it down to 2.8% of that. Absolute carnage.

Solana has been plagued with one disaster after another - first the numerous chain halts, then the revelation that one team was responsible for most of TVL by creating double entries, now the final nail in the coffin has been the implosion of Sam, brining with it the downfall of the chain he shilled so much. Many exchanges are cutting down on exposure to Solana, Even stablecoins are migrating liquidity to other chains 

Do you think this chain can pull itself together after all the fiascos?
 Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I'll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).

There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!

The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won't let me create a post with that many coin names in it. 

EDIT: Oh my God. You Loopers are the worst. For like the 50th time, the reason it was voted in is because of you and the constant shilling. Almost no one in the sub actually hates the coin. 

[The Folio of Hate](https://preview.redd.it/f8qk6b7urf781.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a0c982ec7c5e72119b0f61252fbb9b23b2823a9)
Seriously what reassurance do you want? People who own the same coins are gonna circle jerk your portfolio or tell you to add some more X because they are holding X. You wanna know if your portfolio is decent? Read the white paper for every coin you're invested in, think about what real world problem or issue it's going to solve or make easier. I am about to just unsubscribe from this subreddit because there is nothing but fud, shilling, and stupid ass moon predictions/posts because some small irrelevant fact was announced. I seriously miss what this subreddit used to be about. Done using this for any information anymore. Shit is annoying and is just making people invest in shitcoins. Fucking verge still has a market cap over 2 billion. Rant over. Fuck this subreddit.


Edit: Now that I'm on front page can you guys rate my portfolio?

It's pretty simple really. To get mass adoption to the levels we want, we need an iPhone style event into the market, by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did, but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. They've dumbed down the whole thing, so even half-trained monkey could do it.

This is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains, bridges, multiple ecosystems, multiple wallets etc. it's just too much for the average Joe. Heck, even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps, moving between bridges, converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure, I could just cash out via traditional methods, but I'd lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.

But this will take time, a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet, without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because we've mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X, Y, Z but not coins A, B, C. Until then "mass adoption" is just an empty slogan that won't happen for another 10 years or more.

Edit: Reddit gold?! Thank you kind stranger!
Yesterday, the Wormhole bridge one of Solana's biggest bridges lost $320m in a hack. Within hours, a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.

[Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. ](https://preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d)

The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana "ecosystem" is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. 

In Solana, the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out, leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. 

VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day, unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.

So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking), not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same, you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess, propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix, like what solana is known for. 


When Solana goes down - over night fix.

When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. 

How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?

Edit: The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes, other projects also have VCs, and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs, but none of the ETH project hacks have been "replenished" by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money, well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. 

The first major Solana hack, and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you, then you are just being slow boiled alive. 

Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana "ecosystem" project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium, Bonfida, Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few, an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.
Last night several threads warned about Trezor phishing scam and almost on cue, today I read a post by 7 year crypto veteran that he fell for it and lost everything, about $72,000 in Bitcoin.

It can happen to anyone. You're tired, arguing with your gf, distracted, etc... nobody is perfect. He lost everything. I can't afford that. Shit gives me nightmares.

I've been intending to buy a Trezor for some time now, but I keep hesitating. I've been so nervous about the whole thing. What if I lose my seed phrase? I live n NYC, someone breaks into my apartment, a fire, collapse, etc.. call me paranoid.

Now that Coinbase One offers insurance, I'm not even going to worry about cold storage. I sleep better this way. I don't care about all the "not your keys not your coins" arguments. I have a legally enforceable contract with Coinbase now that I pay for.

True, it's price is kinda steep at $30 a month, but to me it's worth it. It comes with no trading fees which sweetens the pie. Also comes with "priority" customer support, which I tested and only had to wait 2 minutes before I was speaking to a live agent.

So yeah, fuck that. I'm just too paranoid. If US gov ever looks like it's on the verge of collapse, then yeah, I might put it in cold storage before I bounce out of the country. Until them I rest easy with my coins insured on an exchange.

Let the hate begin...

Edit 3: For those of you who calling me a shill, here is a link to the review I wrote a week ago about CB One. It's a fair review. Just my expereince. I don't sugarcoat anything.

EDIT 2: As mentioned, I live in NY. Only CB and Gemini are available here. Kraken and CDC and Binance are not available in NY.  I know that CDC also offers insurance up to $250K and they don't charge for it so long as you use 2FA and whitelisting.

Do kwon was a paper billionaire with no way to cash out without causing a depeg. Heres how he used degenbox to cash out into usdt/usdc

Lets start with what degenbox is: a borrowing protocol where people can loop stablecoin buys. You can stake collateral to buy UST, put it into Anchor, then use your aUST to borrow more UST, put it into Anchor again... You get the drill. It's Anchor on steroids. 

 Terra influencers shilled this strategy en masse, and thousands of retail users began flooding into Degenbox to access the high yields.  This created incredibly thick, near-immovable liquidity near the top of the peg zone (the $0.98 to $1.00 range). In a nutshell, it would allow for someone to cash out billions of UST for MIM at a 1:1 rate without disturbing the peg - all thanks to inorganic demand. 

Here's the total amount of MIM Do Kwon was able to cash out through the MIM/UST pool - without even moving the peg! $2,719,132,772.01, to do with what he pleases. No need to dump LUNA or sell UST on exchanges - he drummed up liquidity from all of you. 

https://preview.redd.it/17acssrn40591.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c39d1c8e03882a24210ee405d9a26e0bb9723184

UST is the future, he said. Decentralized money is sound money, he said. UST won't depeg, he told you. 'Centralized stablecoins will rug you eventually.' So why did he cash out $2.7b from UST into USDT and USDC? Were all those words just lies? (Spoiler: yes.) 

https://preview.redd.it/lnqogfqt40591.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=865f2719dd9ad68966cf5bb029183ad5297ff36d

Here are TFL's outflows. $558m to KuCoin, $1.08b to Binance, $545m to Huobi - you get the gist. Ultimately, all of this money is liquidity being removed from the Terra ecosystem, exacerbating the collapse, bolstering TFL coffers - all while they lied to your face.

Another year.. and another episode of Solana going down.

Today it went down for a few hours in the early morning Asia time, and it took almost 4 hours to bring it back up.

The Solana community blames it on a DDOS attack. Lol

[Solana down. ](https://preview.redd.it/5xnds1jz9m981.jpg?width=1292&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98c0a705d5bb19abebf46aeabed847a9d26c206a)

As the meme goes, the D in Solana stands for decentralisation.

A network that goes down this often will never be able to attract serious traders.

Imagine you are trading on margin and get liquidated because the network was down.. this happens in centralised exchanges. Solana now natively brings this kind of user experience to the blockchain where you can experience network failure on the chain. What a wonderful innovation.

Blaming it on attackers is just dishonesty. A well designed blockchain is not supposed to have attackers, its supposed to keep producing blocks based on the parameters of the network, not take a break because someone spammed transactions.

Edit: So Sol shills have attacked this post, here is some more "proof"

Coinbase blocked withdrawals as a result of Solana network going down

[https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/clt85xbsqc1n](https://status.coinbase.com/incidents/clt85xbsqc1n)

status (dot) solana.. LOL at using Solana's own status page to say the network didnt go down. I guess SOL shills love to remain in their centralised fairyland

Edit 2:

Turns out status dot solana page is lying to its own users. If you go into the Solana official groups, you can see dozens of people complaining about failing transactions, missing balances, transactions not being processed etc.

&#x200B;

Users are repeatedly questioning the validity of the status dot solana page that shows 100% uptime even when the network was down, and even Coinbase flagged it as down.

This is why you dont use a service's own status page to come to conclusions especially if it masquerades as a decentralised blockchain, but in reality is just a glorified database.

Edit 3: This post is brigaded from the Solana sub. Hundreds of Sol shills are trying to pretend the network wasnt down. Ironically, on Sol sub itself, someone agrees that not only did the network go down, but had to be rebooted too. This is hilarious lol, the network was rebooted but status dot solana shows 100% uptime. Well played, centralised tricksters.

[From Solana's own sub - user there agrees the network went down and had to be rebooted. ](https://preview.redd.it/8437dvtr2o981.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=87e1251df337b67335057c9bc25bbf7c979b8c00)

Many more LOLs if you go tough the Solana forums especially the validators groups

TL,dr? Not only did the network go down, as shown by Coinbase status and many complaints on Solana groups, the Solana devs and community managers also tried to suppress whats going on and the Solana status page flat out lies to users.

I would honestly have not bothered going deep into Solana territory, but thanks to the 100 shills who attacked this post, we have all the juicy skeletons coming out of a SOL closet.. what a joke of a database. 
This sub is a joke, no seriously this sub is legitimately bipolar on sentiment and flips on a dime. Here’s a reminder for y’all lurkers here or a wake up call for people who actually take the time of day to shitpost:

1. Nobody who’s even close to being a big player or is knowledgeable about the market is wasting their time on fucking r/cryptocurrency 

2. Most “advice” you get on here is from hodlboys or plain shills trying to jerk their own dicks by echoing the same copy paste moon statements. By the occasional mercy of god there’s a post that makes life worth living but those are usually rare. This post is also not one of them.

3. No you won’t get rich hodling a mass shilled top 100 coin for a week, a month, maybe a year. Jesus Christ if it took early bitcoin miners years to go from a couple hundred to almost 20k you won’t make it with a short term focus.

4. Putting a couple hundred or thousand dollars does not make you an “investor” or at all knowledgeable about blockchain. Losing your money sucks learn from mistakes instead of dragging others down. 

5. Comments that say “3k next it’s over boys” with 30 upvotes does NOT legitimize that claim, assume it’s 31 idiots sharing a herd mentality with no basis for their arbitrary prediction.

6. Anything that has to do with price on r/cryptocurrency should not be taken as financial advice. Nobody on this sub actually know which way the markets will turn, TA works in very niche circumstances and cannot predict movements based around obvious facts or fundamental trends.

That’s all I have to say for now, my fingers are tired. I’ve been in the space for some years now and this sub is a place I frequent despite all the cancerous shit I see daily. The memes are fucking comedy gold and I will always love you guys for being here with me.

TL;DR do your own fucking research and don’t listen to anyone announcing the direction this market is heading.

EDIT: Some people apparently are not seeing the point of this post or get some kind of joy mocking if. Allow me to make some things clear:

No I’m not angry or have any personal salt nor am I projecting my expectations of what this sub SHOULD be but rather I’m only letting people know what this sub IS at the moment and what to be wary for. I was once new to the space and foolishly trusted the advice stemming from fickle sentiments and made mistakes doing so. All I hope to achieve with this post is for people to realize that this is not the place for accurate predictions regarding market movement and to be careful, That’s all.

EDIT 2: Thanks for gold. It is currently too difficult to respond to the sheer volume of comments thus I am unable to  answer every new question that gets posted, sorry.
Ripple labs has been funding "research" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

[Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as "speaking fee" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with "financial support" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say "reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it"

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole "paper" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created "Tin" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting "REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.

Currently, there is a post on the frontpage saying that ADA is overhyped. While the author has some points, most of them can be countered pretty easily. Let me explain

Disclaimer: I am mainly comparing ADA to ETH in this post, and I do not prefer one coin over the other. While I will try to be as objective as possible, for transparency reasons I want you to know that I hold both of them in my personal Portfolio

Let me now list all the arguments people use against Cardano

"ADA doesn't have a working product"

Actually, this isn't correct. First of all, they already have a working POS system, which can't be said about ETH. ADA already has a lot of strategic partnerships, for example the Ethiopian government, which is planning to use a licenced copy of the blockchain to store its students data. 

"ADA has been in development for years!"

Yes, but so does any other crypto, ethereum is still in development, too. This is what makes it great. A working product is a less risky investment, but it also leads to less potential growth. IOHK is developing cardano slowly because they want to get it right and are backing it with research This approach is, in my opinion, the best possible one, as it should eliminate potential fatal errors before a full rollout. 

"ADA is only big because Charles is manipulating its community!"

Charles is engaging with its community all the time, thats right. But he isn't shilling ada. Everything he says is backed by facts, the only thing he is doing is keeping the community updated on the project and providing transparency in the development process. In stark contrast to a lot of other crypto devs, which usually have limited community engagement, Charles is keeping the ADA community up to date, and I am thankful for that 

"ADA will never kill ETH"

It doesn't have to. Multiple PoS chains can coexist, that's the point of decentralisation. Not being forced to use a certain service by a certain company. Charles himself never said that ADA is an eth killer, quite the opposite, he thinks ADA and ETH can co-exist

I am really excited about the future of cardano because I think it is an amazing project with lots of potential. I will keep loading my bags with ada because I believe in it's team and technology

But please take everything I said with a grain of salt, I am just a random person on the internet

Edit: typo
Pretty sure I'm going to get downvoted for this especially with how people literally worship Elon. But fuck him and his manipulation. 

He has brought a level of toxicity to the crypto space that should be shunned rather than welcomed. Whether it is shilling noobs into a massively over inflated meme coin that has no long term prospects due to an infinite marker cap or announcing that his company has bought thousands of bitcoins AFTER buying them to pump the price further for his own gain. His actions are both irresponsible and dare I say it outright illegal.

On top of this he is now taking advantage of NFTs with some idiot offering $1mill+ for a tweet.

If Elon wants to invest in bitcoin thats great but the way he acts and manipulates the market is no better than those shitty pump and dump telegram channels.

Edit - the downvoters are easily startled, but they will soon be back. And in greater numbers 

I did not expect this much controversy on a post!

Edit 2 - corrected some miss information (my bad)
Google HEX scam, they have paid for them to rank in the keywords "is hex a scam" and "hex scam" what genuine brand or company would do this? Very strange. 

There's more - if you scroll further down the page you can see they have made an entire website to let us all know that HEX isn't a scam and people are just mean to them and or jealous haha, wild - see [here](https://www.hexscam.com/)

Here's a [TWEET](https://news.bitcoin.com/andreas-antonopoulos-hex-team-offered-me-10-btc-to-speak-well-of-their-token/) from a journalist where he was offered 10 BTC to say it wasn't a scam.

Hex is an obvious Ponzi scheme and really shouldn't be allowed to operate as they let the community down as a whole and decrease the reputation of genuine projects on the market. 

Literally the 2021 Bitconnect - for those who don't know what Bitconnect was the CEO is being sued 2 billion by USA law currently [more info ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/north-american-bitconnect-head-pleads-140527737.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJwgFQDVLYXfYTi9x8zHauDrP8Q99J97oa3tVLeaWXIiDbEBBz1S3P-cISDJ8HOoF2zO2PX79ddEpqyUv0_ON4nSl-g-r9KhpF5ble0OxTAEsubfODUTb8qO2kqV9NB2f3xC-5JoO9nhRgA9Z-KhIXAAcLNmS_6HeVRSQqA7ku26)

Tldr, don't invest in HEX, it's about as secure as having your sayings in USDT.

EDIT: All of a sudden there has been many many comments shilling and defending the "definitely not a scam coin" please do your own research, a simple Google will show you many articles from respected journalists proving my point.

EDIT 2: furthermore someone sent me screenshots of various telegram groups asking them to "drown out" this post with downvotes and positive comments hahaha.
**Edit: I fucked up and missed a decimal place regarding XLM. That has been corrected.** Thanks, /u/TRossW18. Good catch! That changed things significantly. In thanks, $10 is going to the charity of your choice.

[That post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oq1p0b/coinmarketcap_on_july_23_2017_if_youve_never/) got me to thinking just how many coins completely tanked, so I decided to jump in headfirst and do some research. I apologize in advance for my formatting; I haven't actually tried to type out a legitimately formatted post on reddit in a long time.

First, I am going to show a table of all 100 coins, broken down into sections. The first section will be the Top 10 coins from 4 years ago. Included will be their ticker (their new ticker will be in parentheses, if applicable); the price on July 23, 2017; the current price (the date they ceased to exist in parentheses, if applicable); the percent increase/decrease over the past 4 years; and the ATH price (and date); the percent increase from the snapshot date to ATH (if the ATH was prior to July 23, 2017, it will show a decrease). I will talk about each section a bit before moving on to the next section and, after all the coins are posted, I'll provide some overview and some interesting tidbits.

Note: The Current Price is as of sometime yesterday, as I did my initial research throughout the day. Also, dates are in MMDDYY format. *=Current Top 100, as of the time of my research. Some coins are borderline and may have moved into or out of the current 100 as of this posting.

Below is a table with some stats from the Top 10 from 4 years ago (for monetary stats, I assume a $100 investment across the board, for a total of $10,000 invested). The stats included are: Total Profit (including initial investment); Profit per coin (in this case, the Total Profit/10); how many total coins turned a profit; how many coins went to zero; How many coins went at least 2x; how many coins went at least 4x; how many coins are still in the Top 100 today; which coin had the largest percent increase.

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$3851.27|$385.12|7|0|7|3|9|BTC

Out of this group, obviously BTC performed the best, although ETH is right on its heels. Most of the coins here have had solid run-ups overall. Half of them had their ATH reached in 2021 and, assuming the upward trend eventually picks back up and new ATHs are reached, they will likely have a different ATH in the future. 

XRP especially went bananas in early 2018 and, even though it ~~is~~ was centralized, it was one of /r/cryptocurrency's most shilled coins during that holiday period. Out of these 10 coins, only STRAT is unlikely to ever reach it's July 23, 2017 price point in the future. 

The next grouping will be coins 11-25 from 4 years ago. They had robust market caps, especially for the time, all ranging between $250M-$450M. It is really interesting to see the wild swings in this group, as this is where the gambles really start to take place. It is also where we see our first Zero Coin (coin that drops to nothing). I'm sure some of y'all might be able to guess what it is.

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$1466.44|$97.76|5|2, almost 3|2|0|6|WAVES

Looking at the coins in this group, I was expecting NEO to have the most profit over time. Seeing WAVES slightly higher was surprising. What wasn't surprising was seeing Bitconnect (BCC) be the first Zero Coin Casualty. As an aside, if you had bought BCC on 07/23/17 and sold the day after Carlos Matos yelled his WASO WASO WASO WASO BITCONNNNNEEEEECCCCCTTTT!!!!! meme, you would have gotten out shortly before it reached an ATH and would have gotten about 5.5x return on your investment. That meme was the moment everyone with a brain realized that BCC was a complete scam and the writing was on the wall for a huge dump forthcoming. 

This group did pretty well, even with the BCC, ICN and BCN duds, but this is where the huge swings can be seen for the first time, with the exception of Tether, the one and only stablecoin in the Top 100 from 4 years ago. An abnormality in this group is EOS with its ATH date of April 2018, a good 3 months after the crash started. Intriguing. Next up are the remainder of the Top 50 from 4 years ago, including the biggest gainer of all (I'm sure you all know what it is already).

Here are the totals for this group of 25:

Total Profit|$/Coin|# Profitable Coins|Zero|2x+|4x+|Current Top 100|Biggest Increase
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$13,498.67|$498.17|10|2|5|4|5|DOGE (obviously)

One of the most eye-opening stats here is that there were only 2 Zero Coins in the entire group. That equals the number of Zero Coins from the 11-25 group, with 10 extra coins in this grouping. If you were to pick a coin at random from this group on this date in 2017, you would have a 92% chance of choosing a coin that still exists today. That's pretty impressive. 

Two obvious PNDs exist in this group (PAY and BNT), who both had their ATH prior to the date and both were over 90% off their ATH, reached within 4 weeks of the listing. BNT dropped from its ATH of 23.73 down to 2.15 in a matter of 6 days, while PAY dropped from 86.26 to 1.05 in 24 HOURS. That crash is almost as impressive as TITAN's. 

DOGE obviously carried this group with its 9540% increase. Hypothetically, if you were to invest $100 in each of the 100 coins in this list and all of them crashed to 0 except DOGE, which maintained its trajectory, you would have only lost $460 total out of your $10,000. If you were to cash out DOGE at its ATH, that $100 investment alone would have netted you $36,880. XLM also had much, much better gains than I initially calculated. Very impressive, as well.

Also, I was confused by DGD because it increased by 6.8x but is still only 481st in market cap today. DigixDAO is a unique crypto that is directly tied to gold whereby 1 DGD=1 gram of gold. Supposedly. I'd be interested to hear more about it in the comments if any of you have any working knowledge on how it works, since the price swings look similar to most other crypto. 

The next group is the remaining 50 coins. The real gambles. 38 of the remaining 50 at the time had a market cap of <$50M, with one of them being in the Top 50 for only one day, which happened to be the day of the snapshot. Here are the next 50:

Here are the totals for the bottom 50:

Total Profit|$/Coin|# Profitable Coins|Zero|2x+|4x+|Current Top 100|Biggest Increase
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$3779.42|$75.59|13|6, with 5 others >98% loss|5|3|0|XVG

I found it a bit odd that none of the Top 100 from 4 years ago are currently in the Top 100 now (even though a few are close). There also wasn't nearly as much capitulation as I thought there would be. There are 5 Zero Coins in this group, which is more than the other groups combined (comparing Top 50 to Bottom 50, it was actually close, though). There are a lot of coins with 75% losses, and many that are on the verge of dying completely.

The most fascinating coin to me in this group, and maybe out of the entire research, is COE. It just so happened that this coin debuted on 07/23/17 and was actually off its ATH (or hadn't reached it yet) at the time the Wayback Machine performed its timestamp. That coin hit 1400 during the same day, a few days later was trading under 50 and within 3 months was completely dead. There were other obvious PND's to stay away from in this group. DCT dropped from 19.19 to 3.02 over 4 days just a month prior. MCO had its ICO date 6 weeks prior and was already 77.78% in the red. 

OMNI, while not an obvious PND, was way off it's ATH, which was in late 2013 at 1150. By July 2017, it was trading at 42.99. Now, it's at $4.20. That reminds me of a current coin that is in the Top 25 right now that had a much higher valuation than it currently does *cough cough ICP cough*. It'll be interesting to see where that coin stands in 4 years, if it does at all.

Over 60% of coins in this list had their ATH occur between December 2017 and January 2018. EOS is an anomaly in the fact that it is the only coin to have its ATH in 2018 but not in January. There are 18 coins who had their ATH in 2021 and, assuming the crypto market recovers to reach new ATH's, they are poised to potentially also have new ATH's in the future. The 18 coins are:

BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, XMR, WAVES, DOGE, MAID, DGB, DCR, BAT, DGD, DAWN, ANT, LEO, NMR, RLC and STORJ. 

Finally, out of the 100 coins:

35% turned a profit over 4 years.

12% lost between 75-90% in value. 23% lost between 90-99.98% in value. 10% became casualties and are Zero Coins.

If you threw a dart at the board, you'd have roughly a 1 in 3 shot of making a profit and a 1 in 5 shot of doubling your money.

The chances were greater if you saw obvious PND's and either avoided them or invested but got out in time. The easiest one to predict was BCC. Personally, I was invested in BCC and got out within 15 minutes of seeing their promo video in Singapore, headlined by Carlos Matos. That shit was laughable and it was time to nope the fuck out of there. 

I hope you enjoyed seeing some of these numbers. Personally, it was fun to look into some coins that I haven't thought about in years and to research some that I'd never heard of before. It will be interesting to visit today's Top 100 in 4 years to see which ones have survived and which ones will either be struggling or will be non-existent. Questions and comments are welcome. It's late here (2:30 am), but if I don't get to your question tonight, I'll be sure to look into it tomorrow!

Edit: I forgot to post the total. $100/coin invested makes the total investment $10,000. The total today would be $22,595.80. Over 40% of that is DOGE. The Top 5 Gainers (DOGE, BTC, XLM, ETH, XVG) would account for $13,331.89 of that total, or 60%.
Let me start by saying that there was a lot of times when greed got better of me too. Blinded by $$$, everyone loves a bit of cheap shills from time to time.

But even at this point, on the fundamental level, I feel like I am personally still invested in this space based on technology and the ideals of a better, decentralized, transparent economy - driven by the wealth transfer to the people capable of these things, actually capable of running the world financial and data systems in a tranparent, decent, uncorruptable way - fair for everyone, with no preference on their backgrounds or the amount of wealth they own.

But instead, what I see majority of this space has become, and what kind of people it has attracted due to the possible gains - scares me. We talk mostly about potential profit, ignore the basics, ignore the flaws, praise the corrupt and golden-mouthed, and do not care as far as we gain something from it.

To be fair there is still a lot of very interesting threads about the technicals - but even then 90% of these are basically just a way to make some profit, or reasons to invest to make gains, not actually how this usecase could evolve the current system we live in and in what way it could be used to make things better as they are.

And sorry - being able to swap between random speculative assets with zero intrinsic value on some random defi network - and brainless too-good-to-be-true yield farming is not a usecase that should be praised as our endgame.

I thought we were supposed to be biased against this, but instead we are becoming the same kind of corrupt greedy ecosystem, full of people that care more about their personal gains, just equipped with "cooler" tech. We hate banks and goverments, but at the same time put money into all these shady projects, rug-pulls and obvious scams, run by even worse kind of people. The majority in here wants to realize their dreams of financial independence by ANY means necessary, while hating on their leaders, hedgefund managers, banksters and realtors - who are practically doing the same. It is hypocrisy at its best.

So when I actually think about it, this space is pretty much very similar to the system and people who run the world now - soothed by empty promises, heavy lobbing, ignoring of the base level issues, and nonstop effort to patch these faulty holes with our favourite "evernicesmelling" papers..

And I truly hope we can do better than that. Rant over.

*(PS: The current issues around SOL just prove this point, and the reaction from the fanboys triggers me a lot. Even though it is being in BETA - which 80% of retail investors actually have no idea about - managing tens of billions of dollars and saying funds are safu while the network is halted is definitely not okay, and it shines really bad light on the whole industry - SOL being top 10 coin.I guess SOL have invested much more of their profits to the marketing and satisfaction of early investors, than they had put into making sure their network - hovewer fast it is - is actually secure and decentralized. Top 7 coin being DDOSed and forced to stop is embarrasing at least. So people who put their faith, money and businesses on the network - got left behind once again. And anyone who says it is just FUD, please leave this space and never come back. I do not say SOL won't recover, it is okay to make mistakes and become stronger in the long run - but honey-talking the issue is definitely not the solution. Taking the responsibility and admiting of our own faults should be part of the game. And questioning the centralization of certain protocols is okay too. Some people might even prefer it it seems.*

*But if anyone asks me why BTC/ETH are valued as high as they are, compared to "faster cooler" chains like SOL - it is due to the fact that I can sleep safely sure that my money are actually safe and accessible to me 24/7.)*
Quality projects, with real research, real hard working teams and a vision (won't shill specific ones here) are evaluated well below this brain fart with developers that premine, cannot even communicate a correct fork date, screw up the actual fork and then get their official GitHub client hacked within the first days. 

Disgusting. Dump it while you can.
Edit: Quick everyone, act normal! we made it in [NYTIMES](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/bitcoin-virtual-currency-bubble.html)

Edit: so this post blew up, I want to clarify few things :

- I clearly highlighted to them the risks and rewards of investing and the best investment is to invest in the tech of the coin by doing the right research first, that doesn't matter though since all they are seeing is the price NOW and all coins are down now. 
- I explicitly told them to avoid some scam coins such as bitconnect (and they did so thats good) but again it doesn't matter now since everything is down, the scam coins with the good coins. 
- No I don't expect people to thank me for introducing them to crypto, I only mentioned this part to highlight how they only remembered me when the market dipped. 
- I learned the lesson the hard way, so fuck me sideways if I ever try to talk about crypto to anyone else IRL again 
- Yes I believe the whole market will bounce back soon, do your own research on why crypto was created in the first place. 
- I won't recommend any coins here in this post because the point of this post is not shilling, please do your own research and decide 
- Remember, you only lose / profit when sell, all the numbers you see in your portfolio apps are just that, numbers. 


Original Post:

Mid November I started talking about crypto with my family and friends and gave them a little "push" to start investing small amounts to experiment... I wanted them to make some money because I know they could really use it and I explained how volatile the market rn and the rewards and risk they would have to take and strongly advised them to never ever invest what they can't afford to lose

Some of them got really invested and saw some big gains and started to show off their percentage gains on social media (which is stupid but whatever). 

Noone really thanked me for introducing them to crypto when they made some big gains, they all acted like they got into it because they were smart (before I introduced them to crypto they thought bitcoin was a physical golden coin and can't be bought in fraction), but again whatever I didn't do it for people to thank me I just wanted them to make some money because I know they needed some. 

Fast forward to today morning and FUCK.MY.LIFE I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it's just a correction and don't sell but they aren't listening most of them sold and "cut their loses" before the "bubble burst".

I am never going to talk about crypto with anyone in real life again, fuck em I am not getting involved in this shitty situation ever again
Obviously we all like green and that's why we're invested in this market. But one thing that struck me is how calm or more balanced this sub has become as a result of a bear market.

During the bullrun of 2021 this place was so full of scammers, bots, hype and just pure psychosis that anything reasonable or slightly contrary was off the table. 

Every second post was a shill coin promising to be the next pump with fake replies and down vote armies at the ready. The swings in profit were so large that even just two days of red candles would ignite insane tribalism.

Ever since the bear market I noticed there's some balance going on, people aren't afraid to be honest about the state of the market or even certain projects. Nice to see a little balance, even if only for now.
There has been a bit of a debate on this subreddit about the role of decentralisation in crypto. I believe that decentralisation is the **ONLY** point of crypto. 

Crypto has so many comparable non-crypto centralised alternatives, which can provide the same features. Here is a small list of features that crypto can offer, and a centralised/non-crypto alternative:

* Store of Value - Gold
* Transfer of money - PayPal/CashApp/Payoneer
* Yield products - Bonds/Some investment trusts
* Investment opportunities - Stock market
* NFTs - ownership papers
* Privacy - Cash (admittedly weak, I’m not an XMR shill I promise)

I’m sure I’m missing a few, but my point is that one can access all of these features in a centralised manner. What crypto offers is the ability to access all of these features in a trustless way. I.e. You no longer rely on PayPal to “allow” you to send and withdraw money, it is all done by the network instead. The only differentiating factor between these centralised options and crypto is that crypto does not rely on companies/middle men.

**All other features of a crypto, say fast speed, low fees,  and any other great technical advancements, are just a means to make the decentralised product better, but are not the main feature by any means.** 

Take BTC. It sits at #1 because it is the best store of value of any crypto, but the reason it has any value in the first place is because it is decentralised. 

**Decentralisation gives fundamental value, other features enhance that value.**
In the early days of the internet, media hit pieces tried to blame the internet for energy consumption.

>Somewhere in America, a lump of coal is burned every time a book is ordered on-line.

[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=12b1b1ad2580](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=12b1b1ad2580)

>The current fuel-economy rating: about 1 pound of coal to create,  package, store and move 2 megabytes of data. The digital age, it turns  out, is very energy-intensive. The Internet may someday save us bricks,  mortar and catalog paper, but it is burning up an awful lot of fossil  fuel in the process.  
>  
>There are already over 17,000 pure dot-com companies (Ebay, E-Trade, etc.).  
>  
>The larger ones each represent the electric load of a small village.

Media tried to gaslight and brainwash tech companies with the burning fossil fuel narrative. 

Some 20 years onwards, this entire article reads like a joke. 

>Getting the bits from dot-com to desktop requires still more  electricity. Cisco's 7500 series router, for example, keeps the Web hot  by routing an impressive 400 million bits per second, but to do that it  needs 1.5 kilowatts of power. The wireless Web draws even more power,  because its signals are broadcast in all directions, rather than being  tunneled down a wire or fiber  
>  
>Just fabricating all these digital boxes requires a tremendous amount of  electricity. The billion-dollar fabrication plants are packed with  furnaces, pumps, dryers and ion beams, all electrically driven. It takes  9 kilowatt-hours to etch circuits onto a square inch of silicon, and  about as much power to manufacture an entire PC (1,000 kilowatt-hours)as  it takes to run it for a year. And there are at least 300 of these factories in the U.S. Collectively,  fabs and their suppliers currently consume nearly 1% of the nation's  electric output.  
>  
>The global implications are enormous. Intel projects a billion people  on-line worldwide. That's $1 trillion in computer sales -- and another  $1 trillion investment in a hard-power backbone to supply electricity.  One billion PCs on the Web represent an electric demand equal to the  total capacity of the U.S. today.

Does this resemble the current attacks against cryptocurrencies? 

The exact same arguments are now used against bitcoin, trying to fool people into believing that bitcoin is the worst thing in the world. 

Thousands of people believe what these articles at face value despite not having any understanding of the intricacies of bitcoin mining


Edit: Lmao @ the dumpster fire the comment section is, everyone shilling their premined scamcoins like Nano. Its hilarious seeing Nano paid shills/bag holders trying to compare Nano's recurring spam outage (that costs a trivial $ amount to attack) to BTC 2018, during which you could still send transactions without any problem whatsoever. **Considering the aggressive nature of the shilling in comments, I am forced to update the thread with what Nano actually is...**

Nano is a scam that was premined at the press of a button, distributed among themselves by Colin using funny faucets where the insiders themselves claimed most of the tokens, then abruptly the faucet was closed, the team now having control of most of the coins decided to pump it to yahoo land on a fraudulent exchange and ride into the sunset while also cashing out slowly for years. No wonder Nano price has never even recovered past its early 2018 ATH, after 4 years its still down a huge % from ATH. (thats what happened when you have an endless premine ready to dump on you). Nano peddlers are pushing this as a competitor to BTC lmao. A stablecoin like DAI or USDC on any ETH L2 solution renders Nano as useless. Which is why almost no one talks about Nano except their own bagholders who try to push it aggressively. 


Fraudsters on this tread will try to push such scams to unsuspecting readers lol
The entire market keeps going further down because every 20 minutes there is another "news" report with some doomsday promoting theme. Two bots were responsible for bitcoin's rise from $150-$1000, "China" is freezing bank accounts, etc.

Everyone is being played. You know how easy it is to put out fake news articles. You know that fake news has been used to alter perceptions and mess with elections. This is no different. Dropping false news reports to mess with market prices to cause market swings for profit is straight out of the textbook. 

There is tons of money at play, and you'd be naive to think that all the random FUD articles popping up today are intended to do anything other than instill further panic and sell-offs. Do yourself and everyone a favor, start spreading awareness of this and down vote the FUD.

While I have come to hate everyone in this coin shilling community, I have come to appreciate you guys just as much and would hate to lose you to what is an egregious and coordinated effort to induce panic and destroy our market.
 

[EXPERIMENT - Tracking 2018 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies – Month Fifty-Three - Down -32&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/rxma7hmli1991.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cd4aaf960a1e93d55ac61fbee7def7c90209e15a)

 ***Find the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-49)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the 53rd monthly report for the 2018 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, NEM, DASH, IOTA,** and **Stellar.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for four and a half years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* Snapshots taken on the 1st of each month (snapshot below taken 1 June)
* **May Highlights:** Terra/Lunapocalypse tanks crypto
* **Overall since Jan. 2018:** **ETH** still in the lead, followed by **BTC** the only two in the green.
* **2018+2019+2020+2021+2022 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 124%  vs. S&P500's +28% if invested in the same way.**

## Month Fifty-Three – Down -32%

https://preview.redd.it/qru4ifufj1991.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=920ed4b783e1b03295c9dc645ef4feba52cb9321

The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, XRP, ETH, BCH, ADA, LTC, IOTA, NEM, Dash,** and **Stellar**.  

May highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio:

* **Second all red month in a row**. **Bitcoin** and **Stellar** (both -23%%) fell the least.
* **ETH** maintains the overall lead, with **BTC** in second place.  Only these two cryptos are in the green since January 2018.
* The 2018 Portfolio drops to -32%, a level not seen since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-37/). 

## May Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks since January 2018:

https://preview.redd.it/lqe9bqboj1991.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b8fb4fd501f71e462c68a5e799ebdff64ed1ef93

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018:** Fifty-three months into the 2018 Top Ten Experiment, only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM, Dash, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, IOTA**, and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Tether, BNB, SOL, USDC, BUSD,** and **DOGE.**  

Although some of these older cryptos have held their positions fairly well despite the recent downturn, **NEM** still looks like it might be the first of the 2018 Top Ten to drop out of the Top 100. 

Until this month, **NEM** was the lowest ranked crypto of any of the five Experiments, but, thanks to the May Terra meltdown, that honor now belongs to **LUNA** (see the latest [2022 Top Ten Update](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) for all the gruesome details).

## May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** –  100% red month, but **Bitcoin** and **XLM** dropped the least, ending May down -23%.

***May Losers*** –  **NEM**, dropping -43% this month.

## Overall Update –   ETH in first place, but second place BTC gains ground. NEM in last place, Portfolio back to Jan. 2021 levels

After reaching an All Time High (+72%) in [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46), the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio has continued to lose value.  Currently, it is down -32%, levels not seen since [January 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-37/). 

After nearly four and a half years of holding these cryptos, only 2 out of the 10 cryptos are in the green: **BTC** and **ETH.**

Overall, first place **ETH** (+153%) is ahead of second place **BTC** (+127%), but the gap has been closing in recent months.

The initial $100 invested in first place **ETH** four and a half years ago?  It’s worth $253 today.

**NEM** is at the bottom, down nearly -95% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)**.**  The initial $100 invested in **NEM** fifty-three months ago is worth about $5 today.  

## Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

https://preview.redd.it/rfgwehsrj1991.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f3bc3dbebb7b582d3d07ee3d67dae73938870bc7

End of May 2022 market cap: **$1,237,646,071,341**

Crypto as a sector is up +115% since [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  There was no easy way to achieve this at the time, but if you were able to capture the entire crypto market since New Year’s Day 2018, you’d be doing much, much better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (-32%).  You also would have more than doubled the return of the S&P (+53%) over the same period of time, and eight of the individual cryptos within the 2018 Top Ten (except for **Ethereum and Bitcoin)**.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$114B in** [**January 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.65T in** [**October 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46/)**.**

## Bitcoin dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/n4ad5e5tj1991.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92818dab11c13f9625507e25264f9c514219af32

**BitDom** ticked up in May ending the month at 46.1%.  When considering the entire four and a half year 2018 Experiment time frame, **BTC** dominance is near the low end.  For context:   

Low Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**33% in January 2018**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one).

High Point in the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.5% in August 2019**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-twenty/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2018: 

https://preview.redd.it/rlv3cl3yj1991.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70d2c683b7c811a39416f6627ecb10c5af59070e

If I decided to cash out the 2018 Top Ten Experiment today, **the $1000 initial investment would be worth $683**, -32% from [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  

After a streak of more than a year in (or very near) positive territory, the 2018 portfolio is back on familiar red ground.  For context, in fifty-three months since the start of the 2018 Index Fund Experiment, forty months have been in the red, with only thirteen months of green, all which occurred in 2021/22. 

Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month, since the beginning of the 2018 Experiment nearly 4.5 years ago:

https://preview.redd.it/5m1hxz6zj1991.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3ab54e8b7b0b30d96997cee77a6bde7a24cbda01

The all time high for this portfolio is [October 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-46) (+72%).  The lowest point was in January 2019 when the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio was down [\-88%](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-thirteen/).   

A reminder: no one can predict the value of any crypto tomorrow, let alone next month or next year.  The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio was down -88% after one year, -80% after two years, -25% after three years.

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios

Alright, that’s that for the 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment recap.

But I didn’t stop the Experiment in 2018:  I invested another $1000 into each of the ***2019***, ***2020, 2021,*** ***and 2022*** Top Tens as well.  How are the other Crypto Index Fund Experiments doing?    

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53) down -32% (total value $683)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +238% (total value $3,376)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +381% (total value $4,808) (*best performing portfolio)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +99% (total value $$1,991)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) down -66% (total value $342)

So overall? Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $5,000 total investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$11,200.** 

**That’s up +124%** on the combined portfolios, **down from** [**November’s all time high of +553%**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-47) for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiments.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

***That’s a +124% gain by investing $1k in whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five years in a row.***

## Comparison to S&P 500:

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of the Experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options.  

https://preview.redd.it/yiwc1oo2k1991.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4217d5153d7d6f0aa06e500fd521da3024c326f5

The S&P 500 is up +53% since January 2018, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on [January 1st, 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) would be worth $1,530 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,530 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After five $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $6,390.**

That is up **+28%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+124%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.

Here’s a fancy new chart showing the four year ROI comparison between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:

## Conclusion:

Many thanks to the long-time Experiment followers, appreciate you taking the time to follow along over the years.  For those just getting into crypto, welcome! I hope these reports can somehow give you a taste of what you may be in for as you begin your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and try to enjoy the ride!

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect only two reports per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio (the OG Experiment), which you’re reading now. You can check out the latest  [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27), [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16), and [2022 T](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)[o](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)[p Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) reports as well.

&#x200B;

A bit late this month (went on vacation!) but wanted to share the OG 2018 Top Ten Report for May (snapshot taken 1 June).

The biggest tl;dr from my point of view:  after 15 straight months of being at or over break even, the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio is back in the red, back to where it spent the first 37 months of the Experiment (Control + F for "Here’s a look at the ROI over the life of the experiment, month by month" to see the table).

I've taken the snapshot for the June updates, I'll get those out in the coming days/weeks.
Some **important notes** about analysis   
1. Analysis was done from **1st of January** of each corresponding year till **31st of December** of the same year

2. **KSM**, **AMP**, **SHIBA** *ICO* price was not found, therefore the *ICO* price was used from the earliest historical data from ***CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko***

3. ***n/a*** means that a coin was **not released** that year

4. If a coin was released, for example, in **July 1st 2018**, then the analysis of that year was done from *the date of ICO till 31st of December of the same year*

5. Coins were sorted from the most ***ROI*** from the *ICO* date till **30th of October 2021**
6. Bitcoin didn't have ICO, ICO in the table for BTC means the first day you could have bought it, which was $1 for 1309 BTC, same with XRP, Uniswap, Monero, they had no ICO

https://imgur.com/a/AKG8M1e

Key takeaways

1. **Bitcoin** has the most ***ROI*** from *ICO* date, but compared to other coins, gives less **ROI** each year, still a solid investment
2. **Ethereum** gives better returns than **Bitcoin**, but is worse in ***Bear Market***
3. **Shiba Inu** has pumped only this year. In **2020** it **lost value significantly**, which means maybe after this bull run, it won't give any ROI anymore. Still hard to analyze with only 1 year of history
4. **Axie Infinity, Solana, Kusama,  Polkadot, Helium, Aave, Avalanche, Pancakeswap, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Injective Protocol, Arweave** all were *ICOed* in 2020, and in a span of ***1,5 years*** they gave insane returns, if they continue with the same pace, you can ***10x*** your money in the future
5. ~~**AMP** *ICOed* in 2020 and is ***the only coin*** in this table that gave ***consistent negative returns***~~
6. Our beloved **Algorand** have a negative ***ROI*** from the *ICO*, but if you were buying the dip, you should be good
7. **Litecoin** is like a little brother of Bitcoin that doesn't get any toys. It gives consistent positive ROI but compared to others, it is really little return
8. **Technically almost every coin has pumped at least 500% this year**

EDIT1: NANO price was 0 at ICO in 2015,  this means the return is infinite. But there was a cap for how much you could have gotten, in the evening I’ll fix it, we would count it as it was ICOED at 0.001

EDIT2: Nano ROI was fixed

EDIT3: AMP ROI was fixed

EDIT4: Looks like i got into news, lol

Just about everything about it screams scam.

When you look up info about how to spot a scam coin, one of the things it tells you to look out for is...

###Signs of a scam coin

1. **"Unknown Group of Entrepreneurs are Running it"**

The Federal Reserve is run by a group of "Unknown Private Investors"

2. **Whois lookup on one of their websites comes back anonymous or unavailable.**

WHOIS look up for UsMint .gov  tells me
"Information not available or no support for .gov"

3. **Shilling you to believe it's real by offering multiple periodic Airdrops**.

We're on our 3rd Stimulus now?

4. **Confusing whitepaper thats overwritten, and difficult to understand**

Anyone ever try to read, and understand Federal Reserve banking laws, or policies?
Some things can be understood but usually it's written almost entirely in Dog Latin, and you're going to need a lawyer to interpret that just like you'll need a fraud lawyer with crypto experience to go over that whitepaper when you're going after that scam coin to get your money back.  It's also INSANELY OVERWRITTEN.  The USD white paper will literally take you months to go over and understand. 

5. **GitHub Source has no supply limit set**(Devs can Mint coins)

Ahhh.... Nah, those private investors I don't know wouldn't want to do that. Besides, that would devalue the dollar, and severely hurt their credibility.

Stop spreading conspiracies , and stop doing that weird Crypto thing! You're killing the environment! - non crypto users
We shill the "buy the dip" line on this sub all the time. Constantly people say they'll buy it, but this is where you make good on all those hype moments. DCA over this dip and HODL, we will ALL be winners here 10 years from now.  
  
Not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor.
I have a few issues about daily discussion threads. I'll state those issues, the decision is up to you.

&#x200B;

1. They have huge effect on distributions: Daily threads receive tens  of thousands comments in a single day and approximately 750.000 comments  in a month. According to my calculations (\*not certain) they receive  between 1/3 - 1/2 moons of the total distribution. **Numbers are based on my calculation. They can be wrong or right and they'll be change based on the activity.**
2. Issue: Upvote parties. Upvote parties occur so often in the daily  threads. Moderators do their best but it's almost impossible to moderate  a thread that receives 25-35k comments in a day. Most of those upvote  parties remain unreported, even if they get reported the report result  comes a little bit late due to volume of the sub, so even if they  comment gets removed, their upvotes still stay with them.
3. Spam problem: This thread gets so much spam (shitcoin shills - ads -  karma farming etc.). Again, most of those spams remain unreported and  again, mods doing their best but it's almost impossible to moderate a  thread that receives 25-35k comments in a single day.  For reference, if the daily was its own subreddit, it would be in the top 5 subreddits for comments per day.
4. Off-topic posting: Off-topic posting is against the daily thread  rules but still people keep commenting off-topic. This is also  impossible to moderate due to high volume of comments. 
5. Moon farmers: There are a lot of them. Some of them posts hundreds  of comments in a day and some of them receive hundreds of karma in a  single day from daily threads. This is a big problem. **Moon farmers especially choose daily discussion threads because the comment karma gets 2x (double) karma**. You can see them everyday in those threads with their hundreds of comments. Every. Single. Day.

My solution: **Reduce the karma by 50% for the daily threads.**  This will reduce the incentives for moon farmers and the volume of comments, so moderators can moderate more effective. This also will help  balance the moons ratio. Thanks.

I'm sick of Instagram and Tiktok influencers selling courses and shilling their coins. There are some really good youtubers who can help you with your research but I have problem with the ones who flex their fake trading accounts , showing how they turned $1k into $1m in a couple of months and they will "teach" you how to do it , if you buy their course. If you know how to make a million dollars in a couple of months , why bother selling courses , why not do it again. 

Then there are influencers who do not sell their course but keep shilling the most degenerate coins , that is probably gonna crash (looking at you logan paul). Tiktok is literally filled with this. These influencer use their fans as money making machines .

Most of those courses are about $100, why do you need to sell a $100 course if you can turn $1k to $1m. All of them are frauds. The sad part is most of them are gonna earn a lot of money selling their course by showing their fake portfolio.
Title.                

It's not beyond unreasonable that analysts at whatever financial news outlet have already bought bitcoin. Kramer previously had 10% of his portfolio in gold, then after talking to anthony pompliano he changed that to 5% bitcoin and 5% gold. Why bring up Mad Money host, Kramer?  Cuz he shilled companies that were going bankrupt during the 2008 financial crisis.               

How are youtubers similar to "journalists" in this space? Both make money from you clicking on their content...                  

**Right now I really believe the most important information any of us could have access to is the list of people and companies they represent that signed up to Microstrategy's "bitcoin for business" webinar.**            

EDIT: With regards to "bitcoin supercycle" theory... I think the chances of that happening are slim, but I put it at about a 10% chance. I am not a financial analyst, but the one thing that I think would definitely speed it up is IF we see lightning adopted faster - and that takes taproot mass adoption which *might* become a possibility in November? I'd also like to highlight [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/mminc1/i_work_in_private_wealth_management_in_2017_1_of/) in /r/bitcoin seems useful, if the O.P. is telling the truth. His account is only 3 months old, so you have to take it with a grain of salt...

Here is a list of some influencer price for a shill tweet/retweet or a package deal. Imagine having to pay Lindsey Lohan $25k for a shill tweet for your shitcoin lmao. Most of the people on here do undisclosed tweets, so they don't say ##ad on their tweets which i think is a crime.

How shit of a human do you have to be to retweet rugpulls for only $10-$20 by the way. Utterly embarrassing. If you guys ever see any tweets promoting a shitcoin from these accounts, please know that they are being paid to push that shit to you and you will probably lose your investments!
We get it. Your government can potentially \*\*\*\* this up for everyone. *Like real bad.*

But is this the place where you need to shill your favourite political party and share the same overused "this party bad, this party good" rhetorics? No. There are so many of us that don't give an absolute donkey's ass about why you think one party is better than the other. They are both awful and you're kidding yourself if you think **either** of them has you or your favourite crypto's best interest in mind.

By all means, it is important that many of these topics within the political sphere are discussed and opposed when they threaten the future of our financial independence, freedom of information, etc.

But really, it gets old fast when you all inject your political views into things. If you're going to constantly look for reasons to hate on a political party,  but not actually address the underlying REASONS both parties are equally corrupt when discussing crypto, you're not helping the issue, you're *part* of it.

/rant

*Edit since this blew up way more than I expected:*

Yes, I recognize crypto in its nature is somewhat political since it's tied to money and ultimately affected by monetary policy. I'm not saying don't talk about it.

My point was that it gets old when people use every little thing in the crypto space as a means to support and reaffirm their political bias for one party or another when it's clear they are *both* paid for by the very same people who likely don't want crypto to happen.
You think you'll hodl, you say you'll hodl, but you won't.

Here's the thing, I don't know shit, and you don't know shit. So, now that we are both level headed, you and I both agree we are shitbrains that don't know what will happen in the market, let's talk about psychology.

When BTC 2x, 3x or 5x, your little peepee will get tingly. The memes will be flowing, you'll be big dick swinging in your 1 bedroom basement apartment in the "up and coming" side of town as you check your crypto portfolio multiple times in the middle of the night while people you used to hang out with are out having a good time playing fortnite or whatever the fuck kids are playing these days.

Despite the fact you've already said that you're "in this for the long haul," you're still checking your portfolio like an instagramer stalks people on their timeline.

Why the fuck are you checking prices every 15 minutes still if you're a long term hodler?

The passed10k.gif will come back out of retirement eventually, and you'll be picking colors for your lambo all from your $100 investment into bitshitnect coin.

Then, it will happen. Nobody knows when, but all it takes is a sudden gush of short term traders to sell and wreck your hard hodl'd gains.

You will rush to your favorite shitposting site and blast to the world, "I was just up 3x, now BTC is down 50% in the last week! What's going on? It's that damn whale again, isn't it!?"

A few people will tell you to keep hodling, "This is just the beginning," they say. But you're smarter than that. You just held through a 3x gain, then lost 50% of those gains. You'll soon get  your confirmation bias from a couple dipshit redditors, "Derp, 3x gains ain't nothing to sneeze at. Herp, you should have sold then rebought during this correction and you'd have doubled your stack, hurrrr."

You'll think, "Wow, your hindsight is absolutely right. Next time it happens, I'll be prepared and I will predict the market with 100% accuracy. I'll say I'm a long term hodler, but I'll keep checking the prices 20 times a day hoping to perfectly time the top and bottom. I'm a very stable genius."

Then, BTC will have a small bounce up of 15% the next week. You'll find someone that you agree with on Trading View that tells everyone, "It's going to go retest the shit support at shit level fibonichi 0.69. The pullout method is upon us, there is a 420% chance I'm right, and .007 chance I'm wrong. I'm not your financial adviser, I'm just a guy shilling my ideas hoping I get enough support to influence the market. No collusion!"

You'll sell, the market will bounce back up another 20%, you'll fomo, the market will tank another 50%. You'll sell at another loss, it will drop another 10% and you'll run to reddit, "I knew it was going to drop, so I sold! I just made 10% more by selling"...but you didn't actually buy yet because you think it's going to drop a little bit further.

You won't tell people you also just got wrecked your previous 4 times doing this and you're down more than 70% during a bull run because you kept trying to time the market.

Of those that are reading this now, my guess is, **at best**, only 1 out of every 100 people will actually DCA or just hodl through the next bull run.

There are going to be multiple, and I'm talking many month long shakeouts along the way to wherever BTC is going.

I don't think 99% of people have the patience and the will to hodl through the gains and the massive selloffs.

You're here now, you've been through a bear market. But, seeing gains is a much different beast. I suspect that once you deal with the 3rd or 4th major shakeout after 3x, 5x, 6x gains, I'm talking truly massive 50-75% selloffs in a few days, that you won't be able to stomach it for long.

Some have $10,000-$50,000 invested down here. Imagine in a year that you have 2x, 3x, or 5x that. Then, you lose 70% of your gains in a week.

This is a real possibility, multiple times. Whether you have $100, $1000, or $50,000 invested down here during the bear market, you need to prepare for that feeling of getting absolutely wrecked in a week.

Some among us are going to have their $20,000 turn into $80,000 or $100,000, then drop to $30,000 or $25,000 in the next 12-18 months.

Imagine this happening multiple times, this 3-6x then losing 70% of those gains, multiple times in a relatively short period of time. Imagine months long consolidation after a sell off, then another shakeout after you were just wishing you would have sold.

It's nice to look at a chart in hindsight and say, "Zoom out," but going through it is a lot more difficult than just looking at the past history from a chart.

You'll be able to hodl through 1 or 2 selloffs, but at some point you're going to be having a stressful week or a stressful month in the next few years. it's going to coincide with a massive selloff and you're going to be sitting there thinking, "shit, I would have been better off just selling last time. This shit is too stressful."

For the record, there is nothing wrong with selling at a 2x, 3x, or 5x or whatever you choose, but I remain extremely skeptical that people will actually hodl all the way to the top or near the top of the next bull market, let alone being able to predict when and where that is. Even fewer among us will DCA all the way through and sell at whatever the next top will be.

This is a cruel game, and you won't make it unscathed. Most will fail because of a lack of planning.

Prove me wrong, fellow hodlers and DCAers.

Prove me fucking wrong.

**TL;DR**: Comment based on the title, otherwise read the shit.

*Edit : For the record, I don't know shit, but I do think the top of the next bull market will be $180,000 to $225,000. I have no idea what happens in between now and then. You don't either. And, again, I don't know that it will actually get there, but my spidey senses tell me that. I'd expect it to be around August 2021 and January 2022 though. In a few years. I'll only have about 50% of my stack by that point because I have certain intervals I'm selling because I know I could be wrong; again, I don't know shit so I'm going to sell as I reach certain targets. I'll be DCAing most of the way through, and I'll see you all in crypto hell regardless, you filthy casuals.*
I'm not going to write an essay here about each one, but rather, consider this a one page primer on what to watch out for and how to avoid it.

&#x200B;

**SIM swap**

**How it works:** Scammers use personal info to trick your phone company into transferring your number to their SIM, then use your phone + personal info to gain access to emails, crypto exchanges and more.

**How to avoid it:** Always use an Authenticator based 2FA instead of phone, and don't link email addresses to your phone. Never reveal the phone number / email address attached to your crypto accounts.

&#x200B;

**Fake versions of popular apps, browser extensions and exchange websites.**

**How it works:** You click a link that installs/visits a replica version of the real thing, which will send your passwords and personal info to scammers and/or sneak in scammer wallet addresses when you're transferring crypto. 

**How to avoid it:** Only install apps, wallets and extensions from the official website; triple check any website addresses for anything crypto related. If you use google don't click on the "ad" version of websites, as scammers sometimes pay for their scam version to show up there. 

&#x200B;

**Clipboard Hacks**

**How it works:** Malware takes the crypto address you copied to the clipboard and replaces it with the scammer's address, so your crypto gets sent to the scammer.

**How to avoid it:** Triple check the address you're sending crypto to, if you find you've been compromised, a full reformat + factory reset is the only option. Change all crypto passwords, email passwords, new authenticator on separate device.

&#x200B;

**Gas trap**

**How it works:** Someone posts the seed to a wallet full of ERC20 tokens; in order to take the tokens you need to transfer ETH to the wallet to pay for gas; they have a bot that takes the ETH straight away.

**How to avoid it:** Don't trust anyone giving you free stuff.

&#x200B;

**Pump and Dump Groups**

**How it works:** You join a group that claims they will pump a coin to dump on the general public for a profit, however the organisers have already filled their bags and dump on the group instead when they release the name of the coin. 

**How to avoid it:** Now you know what it looks like you can avoid it.

&#x200B;

**Rug Pull / Exit scam**

**How it works:** Developers of a shitcoin spend months shilling their coin & paying influencers to shill their coin. Once the price has reached a certain point they dump their bags or drain liquidity pools taking everyone's money and the coin's value goes to zero,

**How to avoid it:** Thoroughly research every coin you invest in, make sure the developer team are doxxed and are trustoworthy. Don't buy any coins shilled by influencers. 

&#x200B;

**Social engineering tricks / Phishing**

**How it works:** Scammers trick you into sending them crypto, your seed phrase, or your personal information. They might pretend to be customer service operators or high profile traders and promise you all kinds of things. They will use the medium of email, DMs, social media channels or chat groups.

**How to avoid it:** Don't trust anyone who offers you free stuff. Don't share your seed phrase or personal info with anyone. 

&#x200B;

**Fake exchange or DeFi websites.**

**How it works:** A hot new DeFi project is offering 1000% APY if you deposit your coins with them. Once you transfer the coin, they take it, or you see paper gains but you'll never be able to withdraw, or you get rugged - either way you can never get your money back.

**How to avoid it:** Thoroughly research any exchange or DeFi product before you invest with them.

&#x200B;

**Ponzi/Pyramid coins.**

**How it works:** These coins promise high returns or high gains, usually they involve deflationary tokenomics or other tricks to get people interested, all the price gain however is through other investors, there's no actual product or service associated with the coin and the price will eventually collapse.

**How to avoid it:** Thoroughly research coins before investing - check out some of the DYOR guides that have been posted here. 

&#x200B;

**Fake coins**

**How it works:** Scammers create a coin with a similar name or ticker code to another popular coin and you end up buying the fake coin instead of the real one. 

**How to avoid it:** Check the coin you want is offered on the exchange you're using, triple check the name of the coin your buying and the chain you're buying it on.

We all here exactly know how and why FTX collapsed. We all know that SBF stole all of users funds to use them for himself and his other partners. We also know that this actions lead to millions of lives being ruined.

But many people outside of crypto do not really know what kind of a fraud SBF, FTX and Alameda Research were, why? Because the media has been in a full-time job trying to whitewash the actions of SBF and Co.

Here are some of the few examples from high-level media outlets people trust to show them the truth:

# 

[The Washington Post about FTX-collapse](https://preview.redd.it/ynvfucv6851a1.jpg?width=626&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0bea2b48b9a4aa35a64b0a3bad17f6cdff7feb6f)

I already did an entire post about this 2000-word Washington Post article ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yyq6pq/there_is_a_2000_words_article_now_by_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) that is doing nothing else but show SBFs actions in a good light. They especially highlight his extensive lobbying efforts which according to them were for “pandemic prevention“ and obviously not him trying to have political connection to do whatever he wants.

# 

[Reuters about the FTX-collapse](https://preview.redd.it/0hp96gja851a1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5710fa0f03dbc4a9d63fd8ac2a3ed37454ad77f5)

Now here we do not even have to go further and can see that the headline of this Reuters article is already trying to really make a billion-dollar scam to fill his own pockets look like a “favour“.

# 

[Forbes article on Caroline Ellison](https://preview.redd.it/0rau539d851a1.jpg?width=508&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=decc9733fb2cad9040f21ef884190764888b064c)

Forbes is also just talking good about the co-CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellioson fro whom we have already seen enough videos showing how highly mishandling she was. Forbes is portraying her as a “risk-loving“ person and a “math wiz“. For your kind information Forbes, this “risk-loving“ person risked and lost all the funds of millions of people around the world.

It is clear that the media must have been paid by SBF to write such “shill-articles“ about him and his companies. Nowadays you can not even trust the biggest media outlets to tell people the simple truth of a story that made millions of peoples life worse. Thats just a shame…
I've followed MANA for a while now.

Over the last 9 months they've had an average of 200-350 daily active users.

For a game that's worth $8bn it's MASSIVELY overvalued.

Only this week has their userbase increased to over 1k but I don't see that being sustained due to how expensive Land sales are - which are at a very low volume btw.

You can see the active user data yourself here:


https://catalyst-monitor.vercel.app/


Compare this to a game like VRChat who's got 1m daily active users. VRChat is only worth about $1-2bn based on their last funding round.

There's no logical reason that a metaverse game with only 0.1% of the userbase of VRChat is worth 4x more than it.

This thing pumped due to Zucks little speech, but before that it was never close to it's ath from before. It's a dead metaverse waiting to be dropped.

You've been warned.

Edit:

To be clear. You can't buy fucking VRChat tokens. It's a Non-blockchain project. I'm not shilling VRChat cuz you can't buy it. I'm highlighting just how idiotic Manas market cap is compared to better projects.

Edit 2:

Both founders have left the project and cashed out the majority if not all of their holdings.

Take that as you want.

Founders leaving:

Let me start off by saying that Coinbase is all i use.. so i’m not trying to shill against coinbase. not sure why i torture myself but i do.

So.. first we have the existence of Coinbase normal and Coinbase pro.. which is just a scheme to slap on extra fees to new crypto users. Which is bullshit but that’s not what drives me crazy

Why in the absolute hell are you not able to see your profit and loss in coinbase? You have to download a third app, Cointracker, for the privilege of displaying two basic numbers. 

And that’s not the worst of it. So not only do you have an additional app dedicated solely to displaying your P/L…. THE APP ONLY SHOWS YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIOS PROFIT LOSS. You literally cannot view your P/L for each individual crypto. 

Ok fine. But Say you wanna check out the price history of a crypto before u buy? Sorry bro here at coinbase pro  we only offer 1 minute, 5 minute, 15 minute, 1 H, 6H, and 1Day charts, no need to ever see past 1 day right? What the hell is that? But not to worry! Just keep Coinbase normal on your device and there we will offer you 1 month and 1 year charts. 

It’s batshit crazy to me that crypto is supposed to be on the forefront of technology and one of the biggest apps for purchasing it is built like a high school student made it for a last minute project

EDIT: I just want to add that you guys defending coinbase are lame as hell 😂😂 These multibillion dollar companies don’t need you to defend them, they need to supply a decent damn product. To give an analogy ur the same type of people that if tomorrow Walmart decided to stop offering people shopping carts and people were pissed youd come to Walmart’s defense saying some dumb shit like “oh well i don’t do huge shopping trips so it doesn’t bother me much” or “you can just bring your own shopping cart” 

The point is that shopping carts are an integral part of grocery shopping in the same way that a P/L tracker is an integral part of any investment and it’s insane that a multi billion dollar company doesn’t offer that
There are lots of success stories around here, and sometimes an "how did you get rekt?" thread. But have you consistently been so bad at crypto that it made you laugh out loud and call yourself a dummy? So I thought it'd be cathartic to go down memory lane and write down my painful crypto story, which, as the post title says, is pretty much a textbook guide of what NOT to do. You can read, laugh and who knows, maybe even learn something.

&nbsp;

1) I bought the literal top in December 2017. You know that running joke in crypto how a coin tanks as soon as you buy it? My first BTC buy was on December 16th 2017. Check the charts. I sometimes wonder if I single-handedly fucked the market.


2) I initially bought BTC and ETH. As I was an early adopter of the "buy high sell low" philosophy, I panic sold my BTC shortly after. Then I proceeded to use my precious ETH to chase pumps and shilled shitcoins, signing up left and right on obscure exchanges in the process, and you guessed it, always buying the top of trending alts. To name a few of my shiny early acquisitions: BNTY, DBC, PRL. Thanks /r/cryptocurrency daily discussions!


3) In my everlasting quest to being a super early adopter and smarter than everyone, I had an ICO phase. What's an ICO phase you ask? That's when you share a photo of your passport and your face with complete strangers on the Internet (KYC process, for those unfamiliar), in order to obtain the privilege to invest in their Initial (Shit)Coin Offering, supposedly at bottom price, before they're listed on any exchanges, with little to no guarantees that they're even legit. 
I did however always do diligent research: I ensured the project websites had cool animations and logos, that they used words like "industry-disruptive", and that their subreddit top 10 posts of all times had at least 9 hysterical price predictions. What do I have to show for it? The pride to have sponsored the lavish lifestyle of some "blockchain entrepreneurs", and that my passport is probably used nowadays to rent hookers in Moldova.


4) I stayed too long involved in idealistic and promising, but dying projects (Elastos, Elix, HorizonState, FunFair, Babb). I am ashamed just writing those names down.


5) I bought literal scams, like XTRABYTES and SUBSTRATUM. I'm only missing BITCONNECT for scam bingo. If you guys have a bridge to sell, let me know, I might be interested.


6) The few successes I had, I was too greedy and didn't cash out any profits. I saw NANO do an 8X, then watched it crash back to below my buy price, with a surprised pikachu face all the way up, and all the way down. I by the way almost lost all my Railblocks in the Bitgrail disaster, but thankfully transferred them right before it happened (possibly my "smartest" move to date, completely accidental).


7) I screwed up some decimals when placing orders on IDEX, buying for way higher than market price.

8) I placed some buy orders that never filled because I had set them as Limit instead of Market. God I've done this so many times. I was once even so dumb that I contacted Binance customer service to ask why the order didn't fill…


9) During a coin swap process, I lost private wallet keys, and wrongly updated my passphrase.


10) I wasted so much in transfer fees moving coins in and out of MEW and between exchanges back and forth, most of the time for no good reason.


11) I signed up for all kinds of worthless airdrops that only filled my mailbox with spam.


12) And last but not least, the grand finale: I bought a ledger, but never used it! That's right, I was going be a millionaire, you see, I had to get ready to store all that digital gold. It's still in its plastic wrapping, in my bedside table drawer, staring at me like the [disappointed cricket fan meme](https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sarim-Akhtar.jpg) every time I open it.

&nbsp;

Now, what I did right (I think):


&nbsp;

- I DCAed for a while after the early 2018 crash. As it kept crashing, I eventually stopped throwing good money after bad.


- Whatever shitcoins I had that still had value, I converted them to serious projects like ETH and VET, and I held.


- I fucking stopped trading. How I thought this was something I could do, having literally zero experience on financial markets, is hilarious in retrospect.


- During the long winter bear, I looked at prices only weekly, and kept up to date with general news, but without obsessing. A bit like polishing your meat to an ex-girlfriend you stayed in good terms with, but without the tears.

- I did a lot of reading on crypto throughout the whole ordeal. It's fascinating and despite my financial misfortunes, I'm a firm believer in the future of crypto.


- I bought some ETH when it dropped to $150 early 2020.


- I'm the proud owner of 5000 DOGE.

&nbsp;

Where am I now? Almost breaking even. It took more than three years in the red, but thanks to DCA, holding, and sticking to solid projects, I stayed afloat and it will eventually, hopefully, make up for all the stupid mistakes I made. When I finally break even, I'll reduce my position, keep some ETH, post on crypto forums what a boss I am for being in the green, and that will be the end of a rather long and agonizing learning experience.

&nbsp;

Thank you for reading :]

EDIT: added a link to the disappointed cricket fan meme
influencers shilling shitcoins is nothing new, but it's gotten to a point where i really just cant deal with their scumminess. i'm not sure if my reports actually do anything, but every time i see someone pushing some shitcoin saying that "let's go to the moon!!" or "growing like crazy, get on it now!", i click the extra steps on every single one of their stories to report as a scam. a bit petty, but fuck these people for contributing to rug pulls.

not sure if it would violate any rules, but i also wouldn't be opposed to creating a list of accounts that are known to shill - there should be consequences for being a con artist.

Edit: holy hell, I logged back in and this got more of a response than I expected. thank you, kind strangers for the upvotes and awards!

Because of this response, I plan on combing through these comments and, when I have some free time, figure out the best way to create a shill shame resource for the community. While my singular reports may not achieve much except to briefly calm my rage, perhaps if more of my crypto comrades join in the cause, we might see some change.

Never listen to this guy Kevin, he's delusional.  Sam had access to all trades, liquidations, insider info, listings, pumps dumps.  Got commissions, Got into project that gave him free tokens, printed billions out of thin air with FTT and somehow he found a way to make losing trades and have shit risk and scam all his investors and customers.

And Kevin is sucking him off, wishing to work with him again?  

I've seen some stupid stuff this year but I literally was lmao at this.  If you have anything invested in Kevin's company you should exit ASAP.  

He seemed so risk adverse in that stupid show but here he is showing not an ounce of risk management before, during, after this FTX thing.

Just remember this idiocy the next time he shills you something on his show or interviews.  

Hopefully this is enough characters.  This is comedy, I'm pretty sure.

Don't forget how stupid Raul Pal is either (telling people how great Luna and Sol was).  I can't wait to see Jonah Hill play SBF in the stupid documentary

Just remember in 2024ish when guys pull the same playbook.

Title says it all. Smart phones and social media have without a doubt changed the world rapidly and has forever changed our lives. However there have been growing pains and some unintended consequences of this technology adoption. Do you foresee any unintended consequences as a result of mass adoption of Crypto/Blockchain technology? Obviously there will be major economic changes ranging from job displacement and inflows/outflows of capital to and from this new technology. But I am really focused on the potential societal effects that it may cause.  

What are your thoughts?

EDIT: I was really looking for outside of the box thinking. Not the typical scams, losing money, shills, and pump and dumps we all know about.

Well Jake Paul promoting should have been the biggest red flag but people still went for it. The second red flag was so obvious they said first 15 cards are legendary whoever owns them will get **$2500 every month for life.**

Well they also claimed they will giveaway Jordan shoes. You can guess nobody got them even after 5 months.

 _________________________________________________________________________________________

# New website - https://www.vechain.org/
It has loads of useful information and a well produced introduction video. I would highly recommend reading through the website to get an idea of the scope of what VeChainThor is trying to accomplish. 

###### "We are controlled by the few, the powerful and the greedy. We should be free. Free to choose, to trade, to create. It is time for a new world, a world founded on **safety and security**. A world where everything you do creates power, power for all. And you, you will decide the shape of this world. The power to change the future, is in your hands. VeChain." VeChain Introduction Video

_________________________________________________________________________________________

# What is Blockchain X?

Blockchain X is a global enterprise level public blockchain platform. VeChainThor is referring to their network/protocol as Blockchain X, to differentiate it from Bitcoin (Blockchain 1.0) and Ethereum (Blockchain 2.0 = Blockchain 1.0 + Smart Contracts). 

###Blockchain X = Blockchain 2.0 + IoT + AI + VET/VeThor = A living digital ecosystem

- Blockchain = structure - bones, muscle etc (immutable trustworthy network)
- IoT = senses - touch, vision, taste, smell, sound (collect real world information from RFID/NFC/QR etc.)
- VET/VeThor = bone marrow/blood - generate blood & circulate (value transfer on the network)
- AI = brain - information synthesis (automation of network with deep learning)

 _________________________________________________________________________________________

# VeChainThor: the top candidate for enterprise and government level adoption of Blockchain

VeChainThor has an extremely strong development plan geared towards enterprise and government level adoption. If successful in their execution, I see VeChain being the leading cryptoasset comparable to Ethereum in size. The reasons I believe they will succeed are due to their ecosystem development, innovative governance model, robust economic model and strong strategic partnerships. The evidence of their success is snowballing with each new enterprise level partner and client.

## DApps & Ecosystem development

The infrastructure layer has adoption in mind at the very core. Governments and enterprises will prioritise **safety and security** before venturing into blockchain adoption. (Mentioned in the introduction video.) The core DApps, VeVID (Verified identity, KYC/AML), VeVOT (Voting, Governance tool) and VeSCC (Smart Contract Certification, Regulatory compliance) provide the safety and security that governments and enterprises will demand. Blockchain X will have built-in KYC/AML, Governance and Regulation compliance. This sets it apart from other protocols and ICO platforms.

## Governance model

The governance model is a balanced mix of decentralisation and centralisation. With problems such as Bitcoin's scaling debate, it appears that a purely decentralised governance structure may be inefficient. [VeChain will use a new model of a decentralised system through centralised channels.] (https://www.vechain.org/about#organization) The final decisions will be made in a decentralised democratic process through VeVOT by stakeholders with voting authority. I believe this model will be more widely adopted as it retains some of the efficient centralised channels that enterprise & government are familiar with, while still giving overall control to the network participants via a democratic voting system.

## Economic model

The [two-token economic model] (https://www.vechain.org/technology#vet) splits the value in the network into VET and VeThor. VET's primary function is to generate VeThor. VeThor represents the underlying costs of using the VeChainThor blockchain. All smart contract execution and transactions will require payment with VeThor. Through the dynamic rate of VeThor generation, the fiat value of VeThor can be kept relatively stable. For example, if the VeThor price was too high due to an increase in enterprise demand, the VeThor generation rate can be increased, which increases supply, and brings the price back down. The opposite is also true if the VeThor price is too low. The way I see VET is a store of value, a representation of ownership of part of the network and the right to use the network. Whereas VeThor is the perfect medium of exchange and a pure utility token. By using a two-token system, VeThor can have a stable fiat value over a long period of time. A company will be able to calculate how much VeThor will be needed for a consistent fiat value year after year and will be able to budget for this. This is extremely useful for enterprise and government level adoption since it removes the inherent price volatility from a nascent market like crypto.

VeChain also has a Node system, whereby holding VET generates additional rewards. Nodes of different levels will generate up to 200% additional VeThor compared to the base rate. This encourages long term staking in the network and decreases volatility. See the [Apotheosis Part II article] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278) and [X Series Node article](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-x-series-6b77b746b4b2) for more information. A portion of VET supply will be locked up when nodes activate. Long term VET holders will not sell and downgrade their status. This decreased supply will lead to price increases. Early adopters (Deadline to stake: Before 20th March 2018) will be rewarded in the new X Series Node system. Features include exclusive participation in VeChain ecosystem project whitelists. (Something I'm excited about since I believe there will be a handful of reverse ICOs from traditional enterprise clients)

## Technology

VeChain is planning on adding [more than 100 additional full-time developers by the end of 2018.] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-financial-executive-report-vol-2-2fb65e91dad1)

For those interested in the technology of Blockchain X, I would direct you to the Medium AMAs where the VeChain team have provided detailed answers to common questions. [Hardware 1]
(https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-hardware-questions-part-1-ce7a5f19c3e1), [Hardware 2] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-hardware-questions-part-2-6f6a0c79b630), [Software 1]( https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-software-questions-part-1-cb17c830e458) and [Software 2] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-technical-ama-software-questions-part-2-294a5c58044c) are worth a read.

## Strategic partners

The three strategic partners each play a key role in VeChainThor's expansion. [PWC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers) has clients which make up 85% of the Fortune 500. [DNV-GL] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNV_GL) is the preferred provider of those Fortune 500 companies for management systems certification services. PWC and DNV-GL will serve to introduce their enterprise clients to VeChain and increase adoption. [BitOcean] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-bitocean-7f12402e13b0) is positioning itself as a Fiat on-ramp for Crypto in Japan through physical ATMs and online exchanges, with approval by Japan's Financial Services Authority. BitOcean also plans to operate in China when regulations are finalised. BitOcean represents a Fiat/VET pairing that may serve to decouple VET/BTC and lead to independence of VET from the whims of BTC price.

## Evidence of adoption to date: Existing clients & Investors

VeChain currently has 180 business opportunities in their pipeline for 2018 (compared to 4 use cases in 2016 and 22 in 2017). [They have real uses cases and existing clients](https://www.vechain.org/enterprise#usecases) that range from medium to large enterprises. Revealed clients include Chinese Government [Gui'an New Area project] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf), BMW, Groupe Renault, DIG, Kuehne + Nagel, China Unicom, NRCC - State Tobacco, MLILY, Sunshine culture, Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media, Fanghuwang, YIDA future, Madeforgoods and iTaotaoke. Each of these partnerships deserve a detailed post on their own, they are all available on VeChain's Medium page. Taken together, it becomes clear what type of Ecosystem VeChainThor is trying to build.

Jiangsu Printed Electronics and Xiamen Innov Information Technology are technology partners and I suspect will be mass producing the RFID/NFC chips. 

[Breyer Capital] (https://breyercapital.com/portfolio/) and [Fenbushi capital] (http://www.fenbushi.vc/index_en.html) are the two featured investors on VeChain's website. Jim Breyer generally makes some pretty smart investment decisions. His only other crypto investments are Circle and Ethereum.

**Bonus news**: This week they are presenting with DNV-GL a cold chain supply chain solution at the Global Food Safety Initiative conference 2018. Zoom in and you'll see [VeChain Intelligent Control Display System.] (https://twitter.com/DNVGL/status/970852759615475713) DNV-GL have also launched their new digital assurance solution, My Story™. Four top Italian wine producers are using My Story™ under supervision of the Italian wine authorities. [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/dnvgl/status/971137787226243073?s=21) and [DNVGL] (https://www.dnvgl.com/news/dnv-gl-launches-my-story-the-blockchain-based-solution-to-tell-the-product-s-full-story-113549) link.


## China's potential

China is widely known to be anti-cryptocurrency but extremely pro-blockchain. China's "13th Five year plan 2016-2020" focuses on moving up in the value chain by abandoning old heavy industry and building up bases of modern information-intensive infrastructure, with blockchain and Smart Cities being a key technological focus. VeChain has achieved approval from the Government of the People's Republic of China with [Gui'an New Area project] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_national_government_partnership_guian_release.pdf), multiple mentions on state owned media (CCTV) and deals with state owned enterprises (China Tobacco). China will not fall behind in the international Blockchain race, they will finalise regulations and adopt Blockchain rapidly in the coming years. VeChain appears to be one of the leaders in the field, with their largest office in Shanghai and existing government connections.


## Leader in the field

Last but not least, VeChain is leading the field in a number of areas.

1. [Academic research] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/initiating-veresearch-a-global-research-grant-program-focused-on-innovative-blockchain-1af41dbdc63a): VeResearch with [Michigan State University] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-introduces-michigan-state-university-as-first-veresearch-participant-and-pioneering-the-mec-c8dec3015914) #1 for supply chain management and another university to be announced
2. Transparency: quarterly financial reports, regular social media updates, multiple AMAs, response to r/cryptocurrency ban, directly addressing FUD in official Telegram channels
3. Corporate responsibility: [cryptocurrency disaster recovery plan] (https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-passes-the-first-ever-cryptocurrency-disaster-recovery-plan-from-pwc-f69ccf238a7a) 
4. Environmental responsibility: Carbon bank initiative with DNV-GL

## Skeptics section
In the interests of balanced discussion, I will update this section with skepticism I find in the comments below.

1. "No whitepaper"
 - VeChain are working on a Whitepaper as part of their Q1 2018 goals. Information normally found in a Whitepaper has been made available through the [development plan] (https://cdn.vechain.com/vechain_ico_ideas_of_development_en.pdf). I'm actually not too fussed about not having a whitepaper. For me evidence of enterprise adoption is a more useful indicator of how successful VeChainThor could be.

2. "No official wallet" "No Mainnet"
 - VeChainThor has been operating as a private blockchain since June 2016. Public VeChainThor Blockchain Launch, VeChain Wallet with VeThor Forge Function will be released in Q2 2018 according to the [roadmap.] (https://www.vechain.org/#roadmap)

3. "VeChain are dumping their VET on the open market"
 - False FUD. Addressed by VeChain Foundation directly in the Official Telegram channel.
 - [Telegram quotes from Sunny Lu CEO](https://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/81nv39/sunny_lu_came_into_the_vechain_telegram_chat_to/)
 - [Telegram quotes from Kevin Feng COO]
(https://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/81ok37/kevin_feng_cfo_was_also_in_the_tg_to_address_the/)

4.  "Can we talk about the fact that the BMW "partnership" is not really a partnership? VEN is allowed to participate into a startup program hosted by BMW. BMW is not a client. http://www.bmwstartupgarage.com/partner " - u/DutchDolt
 - "BMWstartupgarage" has neither been confirmed or denied by BMW or VeChain, it has been spread by a youtuber called "Crypto Gem"
 - Going to the website linked, BMW refers to successful participants as both partners and clients
 - This is still a developing partnership with details under NDA, however the VeChain/BMW link has been confirmed at the [VeChain rebranding event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfAEir7uT_g&feature=youtu.be&t=36m48s)
and by [Sarah VeChain Country Manager] (https://twitter.com/mspandorah/status/968441330320855040)

5. "Vote manipulation" "Shilling" "Brigading" "You're a paid shiller"
 - In the past VeChain Telegram Moderators wilfully participated in brigading, leading to the ban on the word "VeChain" for 30 days in r/cryptocurrency
 - It is difficult to differentiate manipulated behaviour and organic behaviour on Reddit, the moderators here do an amazing job getting rid of spam and detecting vote manipulation
 - The Official VeChain Foundation has stepped in to help Reddit moderators prevent VeChain vote manipulation
 - Official Telegram Rules: Brigading & Reddit links: We have a new policy regarding Reddit and 'brigading'. No brigading of any kind will be allowed. If you want to post a Reddit link, do so with the "np." prefix added to its URL, for example "np.reddit.com /r/CryptoCurrency". No spamming for upvotes, as it hurts both of our communities.
 - This is strictly enforced by Telegram moderators and results in a warning then an insta-ban for repeat offenders
 - https://imgur.com/a/sOva9 is being copy-pasted en masse by detractors as evidence of brigading
 - Image shows Boxminig feeling sorry for WTC PR team and a "np" link to a different thread
 - I wish I got paid to shill VeChain, I made this post to share a fundamentally strong crypto with the community

It's amazing how it only took SHIB to go parabolic for everyone here to start shilling shitcoins, asking what the next shitcoin is and praising SHIB and DOGE.

I know this will probably get downvoted to oblivion and beyond, but not even a month ago, people on r/CryptoCurrency would recommend not gambling on shitcoins, and now everyone is here for the shitcoin casino.

If you can't beat them, join them, I guess.

Just remember that you only hear about shitcoins, if they start mooning. The rugpulls and the coins that never moon are countless, and if you shoot in the dark, you will most likely miss.

I'm even wondering if I should tag this as an unpopular opinion post.

Edit: This is tagged Moons, because if you type "moons" in the title, it auto tags it. It was not on purpose.
repost from privacytools sub.

&#x200B;

There’s a reason why brave is generally advised against on privacy subreddits, and even brave wanted it to be removed from [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io/) to hide negativity.

Brave rewards: There’s many reasons why this is terrible for privacy, a lot dont care since it can be “disabled“ but in reality it isn’t actually disabled:

Despite explicitly opting out of telemetry, every few secs a request to: “variations.brave.com”, “laptop-updates.brave.com” which despite its name isn’t just for updates and fetches affiliates for brave rewards, with pings such as grammarly, softonic, uphold e.g. **Despite again explicitly opting out** of brave rewards. There’s also “static1.brave.com”

If you’re on Linux curl the static1 link. curl --head  
 [static1.brave.com](https://static1.brave.com/),  
 if you want proof of even further telemetry: it lists **cloudfare and google**, two unnecessary domains, but most importantly telemetry domains.

But say you were to enable it, which most brave users do since it’s the marketing scheme of the browser, it uses uphold:

>*To verify your identity, we collect your name, address, phone, email, and other similar information. We may also require you to provide additional Personal Data for verification purposes, including your date of birth, taxpayer or government identification number, or a copy of your government-issued identification*  
*Uphold uses Veriff to verify your identity by determining whether a selfie you take matches the photo in your government-issued identification. Veriff’s facial recognition technology collects information from your photos that may include biometric data, and when you provide your selfie, you will be asked to agree that Veriff may process biometric data and other data (including special categories of data) from the photos you submit and share it with Uphold. Automated processes may be used to make a verification decision.*

Oh sweet telemetry, now I can get rich, by earning a single pound every 2 months, with brave taking a 30 percent cut of all profits, all whilst selling my own data, what a deal.

In addition this request: “brave-core-ext.s3.brave.com” seems to either be some sort of shilling or suspicious behaviour since it fetches 5 extensions and installs them. For all we know this could be a **backdoor.**

Previously in their privacy policy they shilled for Facebook, they shared data with Facebook, and afterwards they whitelisted Facebook, Twitter, and large company trackers for money in their adblock: [Source](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/facebook-twitter-trackers-whitelisted-by-brave-browser/). Which is quite ironic, since the whole purpose of its adblock is to block.. tracking.

I’d consider the final grain of salt to be its crappy tor implementation imo. Who makes tor but doesn’t change the dns? [source](https://ramble.pw/f/privacy/2387) It was literally snake oil, all traffic was leaked to your isp, but you were using “tor”. They only realised after backlash as well, which shows how inexperienced some staff were. If they don’t understand something, why implement it as a feature? It causes more harm than good. In fact they still haven’t fixed the extremely unique fingerprint.

There’s many other reasons why a lot of people dislike brave that arent strictly telemetry related. It injecting its own referral links when users purchased cryptocurrency [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23441605). Brave promoting what I’d consider a [scam (archive)](https://archive.vn/cAGpe) on its sponsored backgrounds: etoro where **62%** of users lose all their crypto potentially leading to **bankruptcy**, hence why brave is paid 200 dollars per sign up, because sweet profit. Not only that but it was accused of **theft** on its bat platform [source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18734999), but I can’t fully verify this.

In fact there was a fork of brave *(without telemetry)* a while back, called braver but it was given countless lawsuits by brave, forced to rename, and eventually they gave up out of plain fear. It’s a shame really since open source was designed to encourage the community to participate, not a marketing feature.

**Tl;dr:** Brave‘s taken the fake privacy approach similar to a lot of other companies (e.g edge), use “privacy“ for marketing but in reality providing a hypocritical service which “blocks tracking” but instead tracks you.

*Yes brave is certainly better than chrome for e.g, but its not the best option either, as an alternative for ios: snowhaze or firefox is great, on desktop librewolf or hardened Firefox is also good.*

Edit: wow this blew up! To be clear I copy pasted the post from the privacy tools sub, I am not the author. Also some of you are way too triggered.
I'm totally aware that this will be probably the most downvoted post in the history of this sub. But I don't care.

Algo is the most shilled coin on reddit. I am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought Algo because of the shill. I did the research and on paper everything looked great. Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it's really bad. And I'll tell you why. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.

1. Dapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.
2. Dapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn't a single day without any issues.
3. Official wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It's too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.
4. ALGO is CENTRALIZED
5. No rewards for running own node
6. Yesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.
7. Horrible marketing.
8. No clear roadmap for 2022.
9. Unfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)
10. A lot small ones like poor website (doesn't look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation
11. The Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it's down they claim that it's just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it's because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best. 
12. Poor price action comparing to other scalable solutions. 

Ok some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts. Please research about the recent Hack and algoexplorer problems.

Edit: Thanks for all rewards!
I'm finding it incredible just how many people in crypto are confusing the triple halvening/cliffening which comes with the merge and EIP-1559. I have seen multiple YouTubers (and not the shitty bybit link shilling, shitcoin pumping kind) and many people on Reddit thinking that the cliffening is happening in the next month with EIP-1559. The amount of misinformation is frustrating. People are going to look at EIP-1559's respectable change to ETH supply (but not dramatic like the merge) and claim "oOh, LoOk, EIP-1559 diDn'T MaKe eThEReuM DefLaTioNaRy!" When in reality, EIP-1559 was never going to make ETH deflationary except for when gas fees were well into the hundreds of Gwei, something which is unlikely to last now that layer twos are taking off.

Anyway, let me clarify for anyone who is still unsure:

- **EIP-1559** will reduce the ETH going to miners by an estimated 30% and burn most of the transaction fees going forwards (it will also make gas fees *a lot* more stable. No more guessing what to pay to get into the next block!). This means ~30% less constant selling pressure from miners and anywhere between 0.5 and 5% of the ETH supply being burned each year. Most likely about 1-2% of supply per year based on gas fees over the last year. This would still leave ETH with a net inflation rate of about 1.5-3%.

- **The Merge/The triple halvening/the cliffening** or whatever you want to call it is the move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. To do this, we will be merging the ETH 1 PoW blockchain with the ETH 2.0 PoS blockchain (which currently is running in parallel and has no transactional functionality, just staking, so if you stake your ETH, you're moving it to ETH 2 and waiting for a future update to allow for full transactional functionality on ETH 2.0). This upgrade will result in a reduction of annual ETH issuance from 4.5%pa to 0.5%pa since miners no longer need to be paid for all of the electricity they waste when securing the network It is also worth noting that after the merge, Ethereum will be the most secure and most decentralised blockchain with its over 150,000 validators and greater security guarantees from Proof of Stake due to the ability to slash (punish) bad actors. When combined with EIP-1559, this will result in ETH becoming deflationary or "ultra sound money" since the fees burned through EIP-1559 will be greater in value than new ETH given to validators/stakers. This upgrade is currently looking like it will go live in Q1 2022.

Finally, I would like to give my own 2 wei on the effects of these upgrades. For over a decade now the crypto market cycles have revolved around the Bitcoin halvings when the supply of new coins going to miners halves. This is important because miners are majority sellers. They have electricity bills to pay and so the inflation from new coins is almost always being dumped on the market. If halving this amount can consistently create a parabolic run, then what do you think will happen when Ethereum gets rid of it entirely? There will be no automatic sellers and what little ETH is given to validators will be less likely to be sold as stakers by nature are ETH holders and don't have electricity costs to offset. Meanwhile, ETH is still sitting at a middle ground ETH/BTC ratio compared to the low and its 2017 highs set in a time when ETH had no apps, no DeFi, barely any NFTs except crypto punks, ETH 2.0 and PoS were still a pipe dream and there were no layer 2 scaling solutions. At some point the market will realise the significance of this supply shock and the price will adjust accordingly. Until then, I will keep on stacking ETH.
Didn't think that today would be the day of "*Don't panic*", "*This is just a minor dip*" and suicide hotline posts, but here we are. And what we see is a lot of people panicking in the comments, or attempting to calm their own nerves by telling you guys not to panic and waiting for reassurance in the comments.

This is why we always say to invest only what you can afford to lose. It's boring, but it's true. 

What I've noticed is that many people here:

* Don't do their own research, don't care about tech,
* buy cryptos based on Youtuber's shilling videos,
* or based on shilling comments on Reddit, Discord, etc.,
* or even worse, pick coins based on names and logos,
* and expect to become millionares overnight. 

These people are here to gamble with, and not to invest in cryptocurrencies that one day might disrupt the global financial system.

They must've thought they are really smart and lucky with their gains these past few weeks. But in reality, if I asked my dog to pick 5 random coins from the 4th page of CoinMarketCap, I would've made the same gains probably. 

**If today's price movement scared you, or made you panic, you're in deeper than you should be!**
[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkgJD3QaAAEteb9?format=jpg&name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkgJD3QaAAEteb9?format=jpg&name=large)

Right now, each bitcoin 'produced' by mining generates, on average, around $3,226 in losses to miners:

* Bitcoin Average Mining Costs: $20,095
* BTC/USD: \~$16,869

And the mining net negative has been a reality for a few weeks in a row.

When considering this quick accounting of around $3,226 of losses for each new BTC put into circulation and that every 10 minutes, 6.25 BTC are issued, we are talking about an estimated loss of $120,975/hour.

Draw your own conclusions about this...

This Wednesday (21st), another large mining company demonstrates the difficulties faced in the activity, as Core Scientific filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the USA.

It's not the first, not the second, and probably not the last.

With each new event like this one, the bitcoin network tends towards centralization.  It's scary to think that a network of over $300 billion USD in capitalization has a Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) equal to 2. With 2 entities being responsible for >52% of all hashrate produced.

This is just one more demonstration, among many others, of how flawed Bitcoin's economic and security model is. Or, as the advocates of the leading currency say: "this is just another FUD".

We need to have an open mind to change our minds based on new learnings.

Bitcoin was an excellent idea, which emerged during a major global economic crisis and brought a rare innovation to our monetary and technological system, but technology continued to evolve and the BTC experiment brought us previously unknown answers.

I don't believe bitcoin is the best candidate to continue to bring the innovation we need to decentralized money. Currently, there are already coins that better fulfill some of the functions of bitcoin.

I have my personal favorites, but I don't want this post to be seen as a "shill post", so I will keep this opinion to myself for now.

DYOR!
"Wen lambo" and "hookers and blow" were stock answers to every post on here, and everyone was making plans for their immediate future. There was a new favorite crypto shilled to the moon daily; the FOMO was palpable.

We all thought we were geniuses, walking around with our inflated portfolios, hoarding our crypto and hodling... into the ground, apparently. "BTC $100K EOY" was genuinely on the table. Thinking about that now actually makes me laugh.

One thing I'm sure we all gained is humility. There's a lot less ego around here. Lessons were learned, and I can see those lessons being imparted to the new people entering this space. It's just wild how different it was seven months ago.

**Biggest lesson for me: pull profits.** I've ridden so many things all the way up, and alllll the way back down again.

What has changed for you since last year? What lessons have you learned?
\*Trying this again, as auto-mod removed it\*

&#x200B;

Let me start by saying, no I'm not a Cardano shill, and I'm not telling you to invest in it; I'm simply using it as an example here to showcase that crypto is far more than a fun thing to gamble your money on.

Cardano recently announced it's ambitions to help elevate underdeveloped nations, one way being that they want to "bank the unbanked". Essentially, give people access to more stable and substantial financial services, who would otherwise not have it. The impacts of this could be MASSIVE in countries that are often stricken with political turmoil and local fiat instability. This gives individual citizens, as well as bigger institutional investors a safer way to store their money if conflict or other variables threaten to devalue the local fiat.

I addition to adding an option for more stable finances, they are also hoping to lay down a foundation for African nations to take advantage of. Imagine like an Ethereum network, but with a goal of letting underdeveloped nations have a chance to utilize the full capabilities of blockchain to improve the lives of their citizens. Once example was outlined in a deal between Cardano and the Ethiopian government.

Ethiopia plans to use the Cardano blockchain to track student's progress in education, to determine how to improve said education. But just as with Ethereum and other similar networks, the possibilities are pretty unlimited. Something as simple as improving national education standards in Ethiopia would be a MASSIVE and EXPENSIVE undertaking that could never be afforded without the help of blockchain technology. And the impact of improving education could be astronomical. Seeing any movement like this makes me very happy, and very hopeful.

My point is this:  
Sure, crypto is a really fun hobby and money make for most of us. It is fun to watch the (green) charts, and read up on new projects. But lets not forget that the crypto-sphere is way more than an alternative to the stock market. Many of these projects are driven by extremely driven (possibly delusional sometimes) teams, with ambitions to make the world better for all of humankind. This is the reason I can handle the dips and red days without feeling too down about it; because I truly believe crypto and blockchain tech are the future. They will continue pushing the boundary, and could help solve some of our biggest humanitarian crises. So even if I lose some money on ambitious projects that didn't pan out, I feel good knowing that I am still an active part of bringing in a more positive future for humanity.

Fiat currency has been ruined by corrupt government and greedy corporations; crypto will certainly have it's fair share of that in the near future. I just hope we don't lose sight of the possibilities it puts in the hands of the "non-elite"

If you want to hear any more about the Ethiopia/education project, [here is a good article on it.](https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia)
Enough is enough. I am sick of seeing people getting their hopes up, following their idols or whatever on Twitter and listen to them religiously while they are shilling the living shit out of the shitcoin which they are getting paid for.

These influencers are putting the whole cryptoverse into shame with their shameless actions. Their rewards are so fake that it's ridiculous. No-one will send you 1 eth if you send them your wallet, like and sub and screenshot. Don't fall for it.

Are the followers fools? From my point of view, yes no doubt but I've been in the crypto for a long time and they likely just heard their hero on the internet talking about a big opportunity to get rich. And many of them are just kids. 

Are you missing a good deed this year? Go and report these assholes on Twitter, IG whatever.
First of all I'm not suggesting people should buy or sell their crypto right now this is simply just some simple facts and my opinion. 

I need to preface this by saying the crypto space is in a much different place than it was in at the end of 2017. More people are knowledgeable about blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency industry at large. It's come a long way in a short amount of time.

However every winner is bound to pick up a few "glory chasers" on their way to stardom. Everyone loves a winner, especially a money making winner. And just like seemingly everyone became an overnight Golden State Warriors fan when they found amazing success with the splash bros, the same happened with crypto the last year+. People who were in the past making fun of it were suddenly asking what's the best way to buy Bitcoin. Everyone wanted in. Now many of the tag alongs who were only interested in the gains are jumping off, predictably.

I see so many shills on this sub commenting something along the lines of "now is the time to buy" and regardless of their intentions I feel like an extremely volatile time like this is not a very appropriate time to give out biased opinion based suggestions of whether people should be buying or selling. 

Maybe this is the exact time to buy who knows but it's certainly not a time to risk money you can't afford to lose, given the history of Bitcoin.

-------------------------------------------------------

According to Yahoo Finance Bitcoin peaked in value on:

**December 16th 2017** when it was valued at **$19.716** per coin. 

Then the crash began.

Bitcoin didn't reach it's true floor until a **year later**:

On **December 15th 2018** when it was valued at **$3.191** per coin.

In the span of a year it lost **~84%** of it's peak value. 

It took **three years** for Bitcoin to get back to it's late 2017 peak:

On **December 16th 2020** it finally reached the $19.716 mark again, closing out the day @ $21.310. 

No two crashes are the same. Some take years some take months others a single day. We have no idea what's going to happen but sure as the day is long this is an extremely volatile time so please be careful both with your own currency and what you recommend other people to do with theirs.

**Edit:**

Please take care of your mental health. If you're really going through it, talk to somebody about it, anyone, or write it in a note or on a piece of paper. Just getting the thoughts out helps. Exercise and puppy videos also don't hurt. This will all pass, it's just a matter of time and patience. 
This post is not intended to spread fud, please don't take it that way. What's that saying, those who won't learn from history are doomed to repeat it or something rather. It's better to least know a little about what happened last time and be mentally prepared if it should happen similarly this time. The turn around will hopefully be quicker this time.
***tl;dr: Dont get in love with, or marry you baggs.***

The intention is to not spread more FUD (like we need it right?), but please be aware. 

This recent crash (no, its not a dip; lets call it what it is at this point) has many investors and traders scared to put money into the market. We have seen some of the altcoins get rekt pretty hard.  40-70% loss on the weekly is not uncommon for even top 50 and those are surely supposed to be "good & solid" projects right? Well...think again. 

With the potential upcomming bear market I would like to remind everyone that most alts that are now top 100 might not make it. This time the hype is around staking rewards, DeFi APY pools, NTF's and meme coins. The main focus of 2018 were ICO's. It changes drastically each cycle. As someone who witnessed my portfolio outperform BTC in 2017, only to lose both sats and fiat value by 90% in the early 2018, I would like to inform the new people how things work with altcoins. BTC's dominance is rising again - hinting at the end of altseason.

Consider the following to be true:

1.) It does not matter if the team is good.  
2.) It does not matter if the idea is revolutionary.  
3.) It does not matter that there is a real life usecase for the coin/token.

I see some newcommers on this sub already coming to terms with the fact that it might be over and sayin "ill just hold my alt picks for the longterm, I believe in the project".... Now, yes, some will be good in the longterm... **But most will not.** Even if we go sideways for a few months and then have another leg up in the summer due to good news, institutions buying more, and major platforms(mainly big three ETH, ADA, DOT) with big updates, A LOT of coins will not be there.

I suspect many will never reach their ATH's again. Remember, most of the coins I will mention below were in the top 100 at some point during the 2017-2018 bullrun, perhaps briefly, perhaps for months.

So....

A lookback at some of the coins that were shilled and hyped heavily on the way down from the 2018 peak and never got back to ATH's:

[Iota](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/)

*Price facts:*

It peaked at $5 in december 2017, and bottomed at \~$1 just a few months later in april 2018. Thats an 80% loss. Then it went on to reach a low of as much as $0.1 in the following years. **A loss of 98% from ATH.**

I was buying this at 2.3 and 4.2 all the way up back in 2017, waiting for my guaranteed 10x. Finally got rid of it at 1.7 this year.It never got back to its ATH - peaking just slightly above 2.53 this run.

*The hype surrounding it:*

Reading about it, you could hear stuff like "Blockchain 3.0", and "the bigger the userbase the faster and more secure the network", and "the currency of the future", "it will connect all machines on the internet, making them exchange good in IoTa currency", "the team is smart and hard-working" "a very well designed projects" "will revolutionalize the way smart cars, refrigiratos and phones communicate with each other".

[Request (REQ)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/request/) (frequently hyped and shilled on this sub like VET and LTO today)

*Price facts:*

Had a massive run in extremely short time. This one hit like few others. Was just under 10 cents in december 2017, then it just 10x-ed in a month or so to just uner a dollar, peaking in January. It was free money. Until it one day just wasnt. By april it was trading at 14 cents again. **Now its dead.**  Gone from top 100 for probably forever, forgotten by most. Went under a cent in 2019 (-99.4% from ATH) and came back this year to around 15 cents again. Still like 83% away from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

Didnt really read into it much back then. It was the one that got away and I never got into it. Something something about revolutionazing the paymant industry, putting it on the blockchain. Having an universal storage of transactions. I am talking credit cards, cashback, decentralised and publically viewed on the blockchain and becoming transparent. HUGE. It was all the rage and the cryptospace, especially YTB was losing its mind over it, this sub not beeing immune. I am talking  VET and LTO level shilling.

&#x200B;

[Substratum (SUB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/substratum/)

*Price facts:*

Picture this: Its 30th of December 2017 and you are preparing for new years eve party. You finally dump 2.5k into Substratum after researching it for a week or so, already feeling massive FOMO for missing the price surge from 40 cents to $1. You get 2,517 of them. In 9 days I was sitting on 7.5k, about 5k in pure profits feeling on top of the world. It 3x-ed in 10 days. Why sell? Shit is going to $10 for sure.

....

This one, I still to this day hold. BAGGGS of it. It was delisted on Binance, where my worthless bag resides. I cant do shit with it. It is now trading at 0.004 on an exchange no1 knows about and has no volume. That is a 99.8% price drop from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

My friend pitched it to me saying it will make internet use fair. It was supposed to make search engines fair and it was supposed to do that by decentralising them. HUGE project, solid team. Shilled heavily on YouTube mostly. Exit scam.

&#x200B;

[QuantStamp (QSP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quantstamp/)

*Price facts:*

After 7x-ing its value(from 9 cents to 73 cents) in 2 weeks or less, it went all the way back down to 20 cents before dead-cat-bouncing slightly above 35 again. Then died quite quickly (to like 0.006) with 99.1% loss in the upcomming bear. Got a bump to 10 cents this bullrun.

*The hype surrounding it:*

The first mover advantage into Smart Contact Security. Top notch tech for securing the ETH blockchain, even getting mentions from Vitalik. Huge partnerships, hard working team, and a product we surely need, right? RIGHT??

&#x200B;

[Lisk (LSK)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lisk/) This one was really dear to my heart. I even got my dad into it.

*Price facts:*

It initially lost 76% during the great crash of 2018, and the went on to rebounce somewhat, finally bottomed around %0.7 (a 97% crash) in 2020. This run it never got past $10, I got out at around $8.3 after holding for years.

*The hype surrounding it:*

It was massive. It was aiming to be the biggest blockchain ecosystem around in the years to come, with a pro team and a long roadmap, and you were really early if you buying at $17( I was). 

There was a rumour going around that ALL apps, on ALL playstores, be it android or iPhone would be written on and connected throught Lisk. It was like the main blockchain for mobile app industry. They had events, AMA's, hard working team, a product that the world surely will need. They will be the first in the space. 

The blockchain has also been around since before the bullrun, and that was somehow supposed to prove these guys are legit.  It was stable it was secure it was the future. 

&#x200B;

[Icon(ICX)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/icon/)

*Price facts:*

Crashed from $12 to $3 when everything else was crashing. I bought this one on the way down actually. I let it go at $2.3 this year(almost perfect peak, yay me) after holding all throughout the bear. Bottomed at -95%+ at some point.  

*The hype surrounding it:*

Throwing around big words that noone really understood or took the time to explain such as "aggregator", "interoperability", "layering" and the bunch. It was supposed to connect the one bussines group with another though its network in an effective and decentralised way. Had actually shools and governments as partners. Also Samsung got involved later I think.

&#x200B;

[Power Ledger (POWR)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/power-ledger/) 

*Price facts:*

It was worth like $1.6 at some point, I remember getting into it at 70 cents. Held it all the way through initial crash of like 80+% to 2021, when I let it go for like $38. Peaked at $0.64 this run.

*The hype surrounding it:*

This project was supposed to revolutionalize the energy and electric distribution globally, making it trackable on blockchain, and sending it where there is shortage. Sustainable energy for all. Connected globally. No1 of us though why we need a crypto token to implement this change and why would any big energy firm need a token to implement this change though. It just sounded sooooo coool. 

&#x200B;

[PIVX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pivx/)

*Price facts:*

Crashed from like $13 to $2 (around 80%) in a month or less. Bottomed at sub 25 cents (a 98% loss from ATH ) in 2020. Never came back, but had a bump back to $2 this run. 

*The hype surrounding it:*

Simply put, it was "the Monero killer". Almost no fees, even more secure, more anonymous, cutting edge tech, privacy for days. The future of privacy coins. Masternodes. Proof of stake. Top tech. Buy buy buy. 

&#x200B;

[NEO (or "Antshares" back then).](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/)

*Price facts:*

This beast literally 200x-ed. If you got into it before rebranding, when it was still Antshares you were lucky. It almost reached $200 from sub $1. Crashed hard after China FUD was released(yes China FUD was a thing back then also). From January 15 to April 4th, a loss of 74%. ALMOST came back to ATH this bullrun. It never broke into top 25 I dont think, even though it was firmly in the top 10 for quite some time in 2017. I hodled like 42 of them all these yeas, finally letting it go at $50 this year. I lost like half my money on it.

*The hype surrounding it:*

It was advertised as the Chinese Ethereum killer. Better tech.Better implementations of smart contracts. Harder working team. The fact that is was (somewhat) centralized didnt bother much people. Earning GAS for just holding it was a big deal back then (staking rewards were not really a thing, you see). It was one of the only projects giving passive income. Also a lot of projects were starting on it. 

&#x200B;

[DeepBrainChain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/deepbrain-chain/)

*Price facts:*

Would you like to 6x your money in 10 days?? All you had to do was buy this shitcoin at new year 2018 and sell it at the peak on 9th January 2018. Now trading at around one cent, down 98% from ATH.

*The hype surrounding it:*

An integration of AI and blockchain technology. A revolution in the AI industry. Not anonymous team. Good partnerships, huge offices, dedication, integrity, vision, exelent crowdfunding. The future is ours. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Aion: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aion/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aion/) Was really big back then, but I cant quite remember what  for. Some on my friends held loads of it. Today is sub 300 on cmc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THERE's A LOT MORE.** These are the ones I and my friends remember.

 Hold on to your sats guys.

&#x200B;

**Which projects/coins/tokens do I think will not make it??**

1.) ***The majority of the food shitcoins on Binance Smart Chain*** ...

will just die. I mean, can you imagine buying CAKE, BAKE or BURGER  after what happened last week?? Of course the dog coins and scams on BSC will die also. If/when ETH fixes fee's, Cardano does smart contracts and Polkadot kicks off parachains, there will be less and less need for BNB in the space, and even though the token might(probably will) stay a top 10 for years to come, the BSC ecosystem will surely lose its significance in the crypto space.

2.) ***Memes.***

Everyone loves hype, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter shilling, and dumb money flows into this. But with the recent crash, dumb money is now scared shitless. Yes DOGE might come around again in the next run as the king of memes, but I dont see that hapenning to coins with "safe", "dog" "mars" "elon" "moon" "cum" "pussy" in their name. Its just not happening.

3.) ***Smart contract platforms and Ethereum competitors.***

Dont get me wrong I do believe in multichain world. I think some can coexist. SOME. Not all. I believe Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot are here to stay. They have solid tech, they have hardworking teams and have been around for years now. I also think Cosmos(ATOM) is undervalued and is all tech no hype this run, and thus, didnt get to shine in the spotlight, but can potentially play a big role in the years to come. I am not so sure about Solana, Avalanche, Tezos, Tron, Eos, Icon, Neo, Algorand, Elrond, Nem, Hedera HashGraph, ... etc

I know many of you like these projects. I, too, like some of them. Ask yourself, is there really a space for them in crypto in 3 -10 years??

***4.) Coins that are trying to be "the next" \_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank) and forks that are trying to improve on an existing coin.***

There are countless(actually I think 105) forks of BTC that are now mostly ghost chains. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, BitcoinX, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision; even Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision and ... Bitcoin this and Bitcoin that.  Do you have any idea how fast EthereumClassic(ETC) will die?? Probably even BCH (bcash) and LTC(litecoin) will not make it. For sure others didnt.

Yes Litecoin is objectively better tech(and dear to my heart) than Bitcoin. It does not matter though.

&#x200B;

***tl;dr: Dont get in love with, or marry you baggs.***

&#x200B;

Not financial advice. But you already know that. Good luck in the weeks to come,
1. It’s the last time to buy ETH under 4K again. 
2. Algo went from being a stable coin to everyone’s favorite mover. 
3. Apparently it’s never to late to FOMO into Sol.
4. Don’t talk negatively of ADA, MOONS, or DOGE. 
5. It’s bad to shill coins unless it’s yours, then that’s okay. 
6. People go from being bullish to bearish daily, and suddenly are experts. 
7. People ask for financial advice in the daily, like all the time. 
8. No matter which direction we go, someone’s always pissed off. 
9. Apparently people are losing their minds over not receiving moons yet.

[EXPERIMENT - Tracking 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies – Month Five - Down -66&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/mwqe5p7bxo591.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1bd9b47686f0bfce09ebf3efba84c98eb4ca636b)

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the fourth monthly report for the 2022 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, and AVAX.**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for over four years. Did the same in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.*** ***Learn more about the new features in the 2022 Top Ten Experiment*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2022/)***.***
* **May Highlights:** All coins in red, **LUNA** implodes, loses nearly -100%.
* **New features:** [**TCAP**](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptex/) Total Crypto Market Cap token takes overall lead the Top Ten approach in our friendly competition

## Month Five – Down -66%

https://preview.redd.it/t8jmmdovyo591.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8152e88e72eb9de3cfef8599097b7632a2398f38

The 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, BNB, Solana, ADA, USDC, XRP, LUNA, DOT, AVAX.**  

May highlights for the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Terra/Luna meltdown cuts 2022 Top Ten Portfolio value over half in one month.
* No winners this month and **LUNA** falls -100%, unprecedented during the 4.5 year lifespan of of the Experiments

## May Ranking and Dropouts

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks five months into the 2022 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/81ghgw7xyo591.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b6390c07fb9cf2a10d5f69e5ead94078bade5d2f

**AVAX** and **Luna** have dropped out of the Top Ten, replaced by **BUSD** and **DOGE** (such wow).  ***Luna fell more than two hundred positions in the rankings in May.*** 

For context, since January 2018 no other coin that has started the year in the Top Ten has fallen more than Luna.  Second place would be **NEM** from the 2018 Top Ten, ranked #88 as of the [latest update](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53).

## May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** –  None. For the second month in a row, **BNB** (-22%) fell the least.

***May Losers*** –  All of the Top Ten cryptos.  **Luna** (-100%) had the worst performing month in the 4.5 year history of the Top Ten Experiments.  

## Overall Update: Terra/Luna implode, BTC best performer, BNB in second place

In one month, **LUNA** went from best performing crypto in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio to -100%. 

In terms of individual performance, this is completely without precedent: since starting the Top Ten Experiments in [January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/), no other crypto has imploded this quickly.  Yes, **NEM** and **Dash** from the 2018 Top Ten are down bad (both around -95%), but this has been a slow bleed over 4.5 years.

A Top Ten crypto like **Luna** going to zero practically overnight is a first for the Experiments.  The initial $100 invested in **Luna** just five months ago is worth $0 today.  

**Bitcoin**, down -36% this year, is the best performing of the Top Ten.  **BNB** (-41%) is second place, followed by **ETH** (-51%).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/loos1y16zo591.png?width=333&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=766caa79212f33e678efd60cc49f6d6b5c890a0f

After dropping $214 in April, the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio lost another $420 in May.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2022 is now worth **$342**, down two-thirds of its value just five months ago.  

Here’s a visual summary of the progress so far:

https://preview.redd.it/uszxe608zo591.png?width=223&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e507b65bf5a32e39e6f384279ca635570aad81d8

The 2022 Top Ten Cryptos are still the worst performing of the [five Portfolios](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

## Factoring in USDC Gains

**New feature this year** – In past Experiment years, I have not included stablecoin gains in the monthly reports. These days, there are opportunities to earn ROI using stables alone. I figured this would be especially interesting this year, depending on how the crypto market performs. My goal of this little side quest will be to beat the ROI of as many of the non-stablecoin cryptos in the Experiment as possible.

I started the year using the most straightforward strategies, moving the $100 around to get bonuses (BlockFi then Nexo).  [Last month,](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4) I decided to do something a bit more interesting.  

My choice?  

Convert the **USDC** to **UST**, then deposit the **UST** on Anchor.

Seemed like a good idea at the time.  

Chasing that sweet, sweet, 18% yield.

My **UST** is now worth $1.60.

Here’s a table of the **USDC** side mission so far this year. I’m down -99% in May, and -99% overall.  

https://preview.redd.it/s09t48c9zo591.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=095b23031b7352f27faf3a1b4cad127c6e3cfe1c

Oof.

## 2022 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Total Crypto Market Cap Token (TCAP)

**Another new feature this year** – The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed in the last 4.5 years, including innovative Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects that have created index tokens to capture segments of the crypto market (DeFi, the Metaverse, Blue Chips, etc.) instead of manually buying coins and tokens, like I do for my Experiments.

A project of particular interest to the Top Ten Experiments is the **Total Crypto Market Cap** ([**TCAP**](https://cryptex.finance/)) **token,** created by [Cryptex](https://np.reddit.com/r/cryptex/), which tracks the entire crypto market – exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.

I thought it would be interesting to compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to **TCAP** for a bit of a friendly competition. 

Here’s the question I’ll be tracking this year: ***would I have been better off with $1,000 of TCAP instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***

**May:** Both the **TCAP** token and the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio fell significantly this month, but the damage to the Top Ten portfolio was more severe: the 2022 Top Ten dropped -55% in May and **TCAP** fell -36%

**TCAP** snapshot June 1st: 

https://preview.redd.it/7950qdbbzo591.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e39b2299aa0f0935dc1523cbccb84b03e36e8430

The May monthly victory goes to the **TCAP**.

**Overall:** The 2022 Top Ten Portfolio is currently worth $342 (-66% from January 1st, 2022) which places it below **TCAP’s** $460 (-54% from January 1st, 2022) value.  **TCAP** takes the overall lead as well.  Visual below:

https://preview.redd.it/0i9rpwlczo591.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d59df9ae57966142e85e17927a412a0143599cbf

## Bitcoin Dominance:

BitDom continued to increase this month, ending May at 46.1%. For context, there hasn’t been much movement on this metric so far in 2022. Chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/0gb67imdzo591.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e50b37e680e0612833cd109928bfd3579cadd7db

For those just getting into crypto, it’s worth paying attention to the **Bitcoin** dominance figure, as it signals the appetite for altcoins vs. **BTC.**

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

So, where do we stand if we combine five years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53) down -32% (total value $683)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +238% (total value $3,376)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +381% (total value $4,808) **(best performing portfolio)**
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +99% (total value $$1,991)
* [2022 Top Ten Experiment:](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2022-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5) down -66% (total value $342)

Taking the five portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After five annual $1k investments ($5,000 total) in the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$11,200.** 

**That’s up +124%** on the combined portfolios.  The peak  for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020 for those who do better with visuals:

https://preview.redd.it/k4erhi1fzo591.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba58c819517638e7a7495519c1d93eafdedad119

In summary: ***That’s a +124% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for five straight years***.

## Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/la11hypgzo591.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7de3249bfa33e0c574ba596b7796cf35113be11a

The S&P 500 is down -14% so far in 2022, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $860 had it been redirected to the S&P.  

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,530 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,640 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,270 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,090 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $860 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After five $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 my portfolio would be worth $6,390.**

That is up **+28%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+124%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments: 

https://preview.redd.it/k2hexloizo591.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12dfcca0c22de82f84b9ddf8d5f0b5f9e7a3bfc6

## Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect only two reports from me per month.  May’s extended report is on the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio, which you can access [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-53).  You can check out the latest [2019 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-38), [2020 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-27), and [2021 Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16) reports as well.
Doing your own research is not only heavily advised, but it can also save you from investing in projects doomed to fail. But how do you conclude an effective research on a cryptocurrency?

**Firstly, the DON'TS:**

**#1** \- Don't believe any YouTubers with surprised or hyped faces and video titles such as "AMAZING OPPORTUNITY  🚀 1000X POTENTIAL COIN 😲". They usually just buy heavy bags of low market cap coins, pump them in videos, then dump it when all their viewers bought in as well. Rinse and repeat. 

**#2** \- Don't invest in a cryptocurrency based on one source. Always double or triple-check everything, and take every opinion with a pinch of salt. 

**#3** \- Don't fall for Pump and Dump schemes. They usually involve organized shilling on Reddit, Youtube, Discord, Telegram, etc., claiming to know the next moonshot that will make everyone rich. They do the same as Youtubers, buy bags of a certain coin, "announce" it to everyone involved, and sell their coins when the price is high enough. All the others are left with heavy losses, and the organizers just pick the next coin afterwards and repeat the process the next day. 

**#4** \- Don't ignore math behind cryptocurrencies. What I mean here is we see many newbies come here and say they bought XX,XXX coins because the price was $0.001, and what if it moons and reaches $1,000? Yeah, so prices doesn't work that way. /u/Lovinglyhandmade created a great website to help you better understand market cap potential of alt coins. The website's name is [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com/?c=XMR), and it helps you with calculating the price of many coins if they had the market cap of a different coin such as BTC, ETH. 

**Secondly, what to DO:**

**#1** \- You need to understand the basic terminology of cryptocurrencies first. For example, what is a blockchain? What are alt-coins? What's the difference between a smart contract platform and a DeFi project? If you know these, then great, you can move on to step 2. If not, I suggest you start by researching these terms, and try to understand how crypto works in general. If you can find the time, I'd also suggest reading [bitcoin's whitepaper.](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 

**#2** \- After you know which coin you are researching (and what type of cryptocurrency that is), you need to dive in and start reading and watching content. A lot. Also, don't forget fact-checking, this is crucial. One other thing you should do is list its competitors (for example, if you are researching Ethereum, its competitors include Cardano, Polkadot, Cosmos, etc.), and COMPARE the cryptocurrency you're researching with its rivals. 

***#3*** *- (I'd like to quote* /u/LargeSnorlax *here:)*  
"Look at what's wrong with the coin you're looking at and understand its weaknesses, not just the strengths that the weird minions tell you about all the time.

* Does it lack adoption? How long will that adoption take to come? What are the barriers regarding that?
* Is the technical protocol incomplete? What are the plans regarding that? How long will it take to have a version that fulfills the project's goals?
* Is it decentralized? If not, is there a plan to make it so? When will that plan be complete and what will the protocol sacrifice in order to get there?
* Is the project liquid? Will the developers lose interest if the price does not increase and move on to another project?

I find it's always best to consider the bad things about the project rather than the good things. It's easy to sell someone on the good of a project, and much harder to talk about the bad and how to fix that.”

**#4** \- Google “\[insert coin name\] scam” just to make sure nothing serious comes up. If you happen to find something that might indicate your researched crypto is a scam, make sure to get to the bottom of it. 

**#5** \- Do a background check on the Dev team. Can you find them on social media? Are these real people? (Real photos, real posts, real connections, etc.) 

**#6** \- Do research on people who're already invested in the project. What about the community behind this cryptocurrency? Are they cult-like shillers, talking about nothing but the price of the coin? Conversely, do they talk about tech and its possibilities? Are they optimistic about future updates and developments?

**#7** \- Check the Nakamoto Coefficient to see whether your researched crypto is decentralized (enough) for you to invest in it. 

Hopefully, I could help some of you with your research. As always, if you have any other good tips, make sure to share it with us in the comments! Special thanks to /u/Lovinglyhandmade, /u/LargeSnorlax and /u/ReloDD for inspiring this post. 

Thanks for reading! :)
Good morning all,

We're in a bear market. Shit sucks. But that doesn't mean we can't still have some fun right?

For those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo'd?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility, some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.

So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it fared.

[Folio of Hate](https://preview.redd.it/nfz7ezwmz8y81.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dbbe60dd0b9dbedf2e9dd3a663573cb1f34f6e20)

Down 46% or $460 in five months.

What about the individual results? Surely they're not all bad? Right?

**Best performer:** USDT -0.01 %

**Worst performer:** LRC -70.13 %

**Surprise Performer:** DOGE -31.01%

&#x200B;

[Folio of Hate Individual Performance](https://preview.redd.it/mbx8ck2j09y81.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c4dc40f83b65344c39d037b41cbc77357a9ff0b)

Personal points of interest:

* Investing in Dogecoin - yes Dogecoin - was a better investment than Solana, Cardano, Ripple and Binance.
* Safemoon was not the predicted worst performer ...yet.
* Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to u/entschida for getting that one right.

&#x200B;

I am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. Oh, and fuck you Crypto.com

&#x200B;

Original post from [five months ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rng996/here_it_is_the_subs_most_despised_coins_combined/).

&#x200B;

>Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I'll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).  
>  
>There was a lot of hate from users, towards some coins more so than others. The two most hated were the most hated by a very long way. Merry Christmas everyone!

>The final list in order of most votes and comments is listed in the comment below because the filter won't let me create a post with that many coin names in it.
#**/////Your Guide to Monero, and Why It Has Great Potential/////**


*Marketing*.

It's a dirty word for most members of the Monero community.

It is also one of the most divisive words in the Monero community. Yet, the lack of marketing is one of the most frustrating things for many newcomers.

This is what makes this an unusual post from a member of the Monero community. 

This post is an unabashed and unsolicited analyzation of why I believe Monero to have great potential.

Below I have attempted to outline different reasons why Monero has great potential, beginning with upcoming developments and use cases, to broader economic motives, speculation, and key issues for it to overcome.

I encourage you to discuss and criticise my musings, commenting below if you feel necessary to do so. 




##**///Upcoming Developments///**

**Bulletproofs - A Reduction in Transaction Sizes and Fees**

Since the introduction of Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CT), transaction amounts have been hidden in Monero, albeit at the cost of increased transaction fees and sizes. In order to mitigate this issue, Bulletproofs will soon be added to [reduce both fees and transaction size by 80% to 90%](https://getmonero.org/2017/12/07/Monero-Compatible-Bulletproofs.html). This is great news for those transacting smaller USD amounts as people commonly complained Monero's fees were too high! Not any longer though! [More information can be found here](https://getmonero.org/2017/12/11/A-note-on-fees.html). Bulletproofs are already working on the Monero testnet, and developers were aiming to introduce them in March 2018, however it could be delayed in order to ensure everything is tried and tested. 

**Multisig**

[Multisig has recently been merged!](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/2134) Mulitsig, also called multisignature, is the requirement for a transaction to have two or more signatures before it can be executed. Multisig transactions and addresses are indistinguishable from normal transactions and addresses in Monero, and provide more security than single-signature transactions. It is believed this will lead to additional marketplaces and exchanges to supporting Monero.

**Kovri**

[Kovri](https://getkovri.org/) is an implementation of the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) network. Kovri uses both garlic encryption and garlic routing to create a private, protected overlay-network across the internet. This overlay-network provides users with the ability to effectively hide their geographical location and internet IP address. The good news is Kovri is under heavy development and will be available soon. Unlike other coins' false privacy claims, Kovri is a game changer as it will further elevate Monero as the king of privacy.

**Mobile Wallets**

There is already a working [Android Wallet called Monerujo](https://monerujo.io/) available in the Google Play Store. [X Wallet](https://xwallet.tech/) is an IOS mobile wallet. One of the X Wallet developers [recently announced](https://twitter.com/rusticbison/status/951760058131664896) they are very, very close to being listed in the Apple App Store, however are having some [issues with getting it approved](https://twitter.com/rusticbison/status/953619818602729473). The official Monero IOS and Android wallets, along with the MyMonero IOS and Android wallets, are also almost ready to be released, and can be expected very soon.

**Hardware Wallets** 

Hardware wallets are currently being developed and nearing completion. Because Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol, it means it requires unique development in order to allow hardware wallet integration. The [Ledger Nano S will be adding Monero support by the end of Q1 2018](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7kwbf9/ledger_to_have_monero_support_before_end_of_q1/). [There is a recent update here too.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pfj0z/ledger_hardware_wallet_monero_integration_some/) Even better, for the first time ever in cryptocurrency history, the Monero community banded together to fund the development of an exclusive Monero Hardware Wallet, and will be available in Q2 2018, costing [only about $20!](https://btcmanager.com/monero-hardware-wallet-prototype-announced-at-34c3/) In addition, [the CEO of Trezor has offered a 10BTC bounty](https://twitter.com/slushcz/status/932632838435782658) to whoever can provide the software to allow Monero integration. Someone can be seen to [already be working on that here](https://github.com/dominik-selmeci/monero-python-poc). 

**TAILS  Operating System Integration**

Monero is in the progress of being packaged in order for it to be integrated into [TAILS](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/2395) and ready to use upon install. TAILS is the operating system popularised by Edward Snowden and is commonly used by those requiring privacy such as [journalists wanting to protect themselves and sources, human-right defenders organizing in repressive contexts, citizens facing national emergencies, domestic violence survivors escaping from their abusers](https://tails.boum.org/news/who_are_you_helping/index.en.html), and consequently, darknet market users.

In the meantime, for those users who wish to use TAILS with Monero, u/Electric_sheep01 has provided [Sheep's Noob guide to Monero GUI in Tails 3.2](https://medium.com/@Electricsheep56/sheeps-noob-guide-to-monero-gui-in-tails-3-2-d75c4e829c17), which is a step-by-step guide with screenshots explaining how to setup Monero in TAILS, and is very easy to follow.

**Mandatory Hardforks** 

Unlike other coins, Monero receives a protocol upgrade every 6 months in March and September. Think of it as a *Consensus Protocol Update*. Monero's hard forks ensure quality development takes place, while preventing political or ideological issues from hindering progress. When a hardfork occurs, you simply download and use the new daemon version, and your existing wallet files and copy of the blockchain remain compatible. [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6yprar/mandatory_upgrade_monero_01100_helium_hydra/) provides more information.

**Dynamic fees** 

Many cryptocurrencies have an arbitrary block size limit. Although Monero has a limit, it is adaptive based on the past 100 blocks. Similarly, fees change based on transaction volume. As more transactions are processed on the Monero network, the block size limit slowly increases and the fees slowly decrease. The opposite effect also holds true. This means that the more transactions that take place, the cheaper the fees!

**Tail Emission and Inflation**

There will be around 18.4 million Monero mined at the end of May 2022. However, tail emission will kick in after that which is 0.6 XMR, so it has no fixed limit. [Gundamlancer explains](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4205/what-is-the-total-supply-of-monero-and-when-will-it-be-finished-mining) that Monero's *"main emission curve will issue about 18.4 million coins to be mined in approximately 8 years. (more precisely 18.132 Million coins by ca. end of May 2022) After that, a constant "tail emission" of 0.6 XMR per 2-minutes block (modified from initially equivalent 0.3 XMR per 1-minute block) will create a sub-1% perpetual inflatio starting with 0.87% yearly inflation around May 2022) to prevent the lack of incentives for miners once a currency is not mineable anymore.*

**Monero Research Lab** 

Monero has a group of anonymous/pseudo-anonymous university academics actively researching, developing, and publishing academic papers in order to improve Monero. See [here](https://lab.getmonero.org/) and [here](https://github.com/b-g-goodell/research-lab). The Monero Research Lab are acquainted with other members of cryptocurrency academic community to ensure when new research or technology is uncovered, it can be reviewed and decided upon whether it would be beneficial to Monero. This ensures Monero will always remain a leading cryptocurrency. A recent end of 2017 update from a MRL researcher can be found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7r3lvu/suraes_delayed_end_of_december_update/).




##**///Monero's Technology - Rising Above The Rest///**

**Monero Has Already Proven Itself To Be Private, Secure, Untraceable, and Trustless** 

Monero is the only private, untraceable, trustless, secure and fungible cryptocurrency. [Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are TRACEABLE through the use of blockchain analytics](http://www.trustnodes.com/2018/01/09/bitfury-de-anonymises-millions-bitcoin-transactions-addresses), and has lead to the prosecution of numerous individuals, such as the alleged [Alphabay administrator Alexandre Cazes](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-curious-cases-of-the-alphabay-kingpin-and-hansa-takedowns/). In the [Forfeiture Complaint which detailed the asset seizure of Alexandre Cazes](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/982821/download), the anonymity capabilities of Monero were self-demonstrated by the following statement of the officials after the AlphaBay shutdown: *"In total, from CAZES' wallets and computer agents took control of approximately $8,800,000 in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and Zcash, broken down as follows: 1,605.0503851 Bitcoin, 8,309.271639 Ethereum, 3,691.98 Zcash, and an unknown amount of Monero"*. 

Privacy CANNOT BE OPTIONAL and must be at a PROTOCOL LEVEL. With Monero, privacy is mandatory, so that everyone gets the benefits of privacy without any transactions standing out as suspicious. This is the reason Darknet Market places are moving to Monero, and will never use Verge, Zcash, Dash, Pivx, Sumo, Spectre, Hush or any other coins that lack good privacy. Peter Todd (who was involved in the Zcash trusted setup ceremony) recently [reiterated his concerns]( https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/937929196688592896) of optional privacy after Jeffrey Quesnelle published his [recent paper]( http://jeffq.com/blog/on-the-linkability-of-zcash-transactions/) stating 31.5% of Zcash transactions may be traceable, and that only ~1% of the transactions are pure privacy transactions (i.e., z -> z transactions). When the attempted private transactions stand out like a sore thumb there is no privacy, hence why privacy cannot be optional. In addition, in order for a cryptocurrency to truly be private, it must not be controlled by a centralised body, such as a company or organisation, because it opens it up to government control and restrictions. This is no joke, [but Zcash is supported by DARPA and the Israeli government!](http://zerocash-project.org/about_us). 

Monero provides a stark contrast compared to other supposed privacy coins, in that Monero does not have a rich list! With all other coins, you can view wallet balances on the blockexplorers. [You can view Monero's non-existent rich list here](https://moneroblocks.info/richlist) to see for yourself.

I will reiterate here that Monero is TRUSTLESS. You don't need to rely on anyone else to protect your privacy, or worry about others colluding to learn more about you. No one can censor your transaction or decide to intervene. Monero is immutable, unlike [Zcash, in which the lead developer Zooko publicly tweeted the possibility of providing a backdoor for authorities to trace transactions](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/863202798883577856). To Zcash's demise, Zooko famously tweeted:

>" And by the way, I think we can successfully make Zcash too traceable for criminals like WannaCry, but still completely private & fungible. …"

Ethereum's track record of immutability is also poor. Ethereum was supposed to be an immutable blockchain ledger, however after the DAO hack this proved to not be the case. [A 2016 article on Saintly Law](http://www.saintylaw.com.au/2016/10/12/lessons-learned-dao-hack-blockchain-smart-contracts-security/) summarised the problematic nature of Ethereum's leadership and blockchain intervention:

>" Many ethereum and blockchain advocates believe that the intervention was the wrong move to make in this situation. Smart contracts are meant to be self-executing, immutable and free from disturbance by organisations and intermediaries. Yet the building block of all smart contracts, the code, is inherently imperfect. This means that the technology is vulnerable to the same malicious hackers that are targeting businesses and governments. It is also clear that the large scale intervention after the DAO hack could not and would not likely be taken in smaller transactions, as they greatly undermine the viability of the cryptocurrency and the technology."




**Monero provides Fungibility and Privacy in a Cashless World**

As outlined on [GetMonero.org]( https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/fungibility.html), fungibility is the property of a currency whereby two units can be substituted in place of one another. Fungibility means that two units of a currency can be mutually substituted and the substituted currency is equal to another unit of the same size. For example, two $10 bills can be exchanged and they are functionally identical to any other $10 bill in circulation (although $10 bills have unique ID numbers and are therefore not completely fungible). Gold is probably a closer example of true fungibility, where any 1 oz. of gold of the same grade is worth the same as another 1 oz. of gold. Monero is fungible due to the nature of the currency which provides no way to link transactions together nor trace the history of any particular XMR. 1 XMR is functionally identical to any other 1 XMR. Fungibility is an advantage Monero has over Bitcoin and almost every other cryptocurrency, due to the privacy inherent in the Monero blockchain and the permanently traceable nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. With Bitcoin, any BTC can be tracked by anyone back to its creation coinbase transaction. Therefore, if a coin has been used for an illegal purpose in the past, this history will be contained in the blockchain in perpetuity. 

A great example of [Bitcoin's lack of fungibility was reposted]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6uldp2/monero_privacy_is_not_a_crime_or_something_to/dlto4fn/) by u/ViolentlyPeaceful: 

>"Imagine you sell cupcakes and receive Bitcoin as payment. It turns out that someone who owned that Bitcoin before you was involved in criminal activity. Now you are worried that you have become a suspect in a criminal case, because the movement of funds to you is a matter of public record. You are also worried that certain Bitcoins that you thought you owned will be considered ‘tainted’ and that others will refuse to accept them as payment." 

This lack of fungibility means that certain businesses will be obligated to avoid accepting BTC that have been previously used for purposes which are illegal, or simply run afoul of their Terms of Service. Currently some large Bitcoin companies are blocking, suspending, or closing accounts that have received Bitcoin used in online gambling or other purposes deemed unsavory by said companies. Monero has been built specifically to address the problem of traceability and non-fungibility inherent in other cryptocurrencies. By having completely private transactions Monero is truly fungible and there can be no blacklisting of certain XMR, while at the same time providing all the benefits of a secure, decentralized, permanent blockchain. 

The world is moving cashless. Fact. The ramifications of this are enormous as we move into a cashless world in which transactions will be tracked and [there is a potential for data to be used by third parties for adverse purposes](http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2114086/cashless-society-would-destroy-our-privacy-and-freedom). While most new cryptocurrency investors speculate upon vaporware ICO tokens in the hope of generating wealth, Monero provides salvation for those in which financial privacy is paramount. Too often people equate Monero's features with criminal endeavors. Privacy is not a crime, and is necessary for good money. Transparency in Monero is possible OFF-CHAIN, which offers greater transparency and flexibility. For example, a Monero user may share their *Private View Key* with their accountant for tax purposes. 

Monero aims to be adopted by more than just those with nefarious use cases. For example, if you lived in an oppressive religious regime and wanted to buy a certain item, using Monero would allow you to exchange value privately and across borders if needed. Another example is that if everybody can see how much cryptocurrency you have in your wallet, then a certain service might decide to charge you more, and bad actors could even use knowledge of your wallet balance to target you for extortion purposes. For example, [a Russian cryptocurrency blogger was recently beaten and robbed of $425k](https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-blogger-who-boasted-about-crypto-wealth-beaten-and-robbed-for-425k). This is why FUNGIBILITY IS ESSENTIAL. [To summarise this in a nutshell:](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6uldp2/monero_privacy_is_not_a_crime_or_something_to/)

>"A lack of fungibility means that when sending or receiving funds, if the other person personally knows you during a transaction, or can get any sort of information on you, or if you provide a residential address for shipping etc. – you could quite potentially have them use this against you for personal gain"

For those that wish to seek more information about why Monero is a superior form of money, read [The Merits of Monero: Why Monero Vs Bitcoin](https://www.monero.how/why-monero-vs-bitcoin) over on the [Monero.how](https://www.monero.how/why-monero-vs-bitcoin) website.



**Monero's Humble Origins** 

Something that still rings true today despite the great influx of money into cryptocurrencies was  outlined in Nick Tomaino's early 2016 [opinion piece]( https://thecontrol.co/meet-the-best-performing-digital-currency-of-2016-monero-e6010768e54a). The author claimed that *"one of the most interesting aspects of Monero is that the project has gained traction without a crowd sale pre-launch, without VC funding and any company or well-known investors and without a pre-mine. Like Bitcoin in the early days, Monero has been a purely grassroots movement that was bootstrapped by the creator and adopted organically without any institutional buy-in. The creator and most of the core developers serve the community pseudonymously and the project was launched on a message board (similar to the way Bitcoin was launched on an email newsletter)."*

**The Organic Growth of the Monero Community** 

The Monero community over at r/monero is exponentially growing. You can view the [Monero reddit metrics here]( http://redditmetrics.com/r/Monero) and see that the Monero subreddit currently gains more than 10,000 (yes, ten thousand!) new subscribers every 10 days! Compare this to most of the other coins out there, and it proves to be one of the only projects with real organic growth. In addition to this, the community subreddits are specifically divided to ensure the main subreddit remains unbiased, tech focused, with no shilling or hype. All trading talk is designated to r/xmrtrader, and all memes at r/moonero. 

**Forum Funding System** 

While most contributors have gratefully volunteered their time to the project, Monero also has a Forum Funding System in which money is donated by community members to ensure it attracts and retains the brightest minds and most skilled developers. Unlike ICOs and other cryptocurrencies, Monero never had a premine, and does not have a developer tax. If ANYONE requires funding for a Monero related project, then they can simply request funding from the community, and if the community sees it as beneficial, they will donate. Types of projects range from Monero funding for local meet ups, to paying developers for their work.

**Monero For Goods, Services, and Market Places** 

[There is a growing number of online goods and services](https://getmonero.org/community/merchants/) that you can now pay for with Monero. 
[Globee](https://globee.com/) is a service that allows online merchants to accept payments through credit cards and a host of cryptocurrencies, while being settled in Bitcoin, Monero or fiat currency. Merchants can reach a wider variety of customers, while not needing to invest in additional hardware to run cryptocurrency wallets or accept the current instability of the cryptocurrency market. Globee uses all of the open source API's that BitPay does making integrations much easier! 

[Project Coral Reef](https://www.projectcoralreef.com) is a service which allows you to shop and pay for popular music band products and services using Monero. 

Linux, Veracrypt, and a whole array of VPNs now accept Monero.

There is a new Monero only marketplace called Annularis [currently being developed]( https://github.com/annularis/shop) which has been created for those who value financial privacy and economic freedom, and there are rumours [Open Bazaar](https://www.openbazaar.org/) is likely to support Monero once Multisig is implemented. 

In addition, Monero is also supported by [The Living Room of Satoshi](https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/) so you can pay bills or credit cards directly using Monero. 

Monero can be found on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchange services such as Bittrex, Poloniex, Cryptopia, Shapeshift, Changelly, Bitfinex, Kraken,  Bisq, Tux, [and many others](https://getmonero.org/community/merchants/).

For those wishing to purchase Monero anonymously, there are services such as [LocalMonero.co](https://localmonero.co/) and [Moneroforcash.com](https://moneroforcash.com/).

With [XMR.TO](https://xmr.to/) you can pay Bitcoin addresses directly with Monero. There are no other fees than the miner ones. All user records are purged after 48 hours. XMR.TO has also been added as an embedded feature into the Monerujo android wallet.

**Coinhive Browser-Based Mining** 

Unlike Bitcoin, Monero can be mined using CPUs and GPUs. Not only does this encourage decentralisation, it also opens the door to browser based mining. Enter side of stage, Coinhive browser-based mining. As described by [Hon Lau on the Symnatec Blog](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/browser-mining-cryptocurrency) Browser-based mining, as its name suggests, is a method of cryptocurrency mining that happens inside a browser and is implemented using Javascript. Coinhive is marketed as an alternative to browser ad revenue. The motivation behind this is simple: users pay for the content indirectly by coin mining when they visit the site and website owners don't have to bother users with sites laden with ads, trackers, and all the associated paraphern. This is great, provided that the websites are transparent with site visitors and notify users of the mining that will be taking place, or better still, offer users a way to opt in, although this hasn't always been the case thus far.

**Skepticism Sunday**

The main Monero subreddit has weekly [Skepticism Sundays](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/75w7wt/can_we_make_skepticism_sunday_a_part_of_the/) which was created with the purpose of installing *"a culture of being scientific, skeptical, and rational"*. This is used to have open, critical discussions about monero as a technology, it's economics, and so on.




##**///Speculation///**

**Major Investors And Crypto Figureheads Are Interested** 

Ari Paul is the co-founder and CIO of BlockTower Capital. He was previously a portfolio manager for the University of Chicago's $8 billion endowment, and a derivatives market maker and proprietary trader for Susquehanna International Group. Paul was interviewed on CNBC on the 26th of December and when asked what was his favourite coin was, he stated *"One that has real fundamental value besides from Bitcoin is Monero"* and said it has *"very strong engineering"*. In addition, when he was asked if that was the one used by criminals, he replied *"Everything is used by criminals including the US dollar and the Euro"*. Paul later supported these claims on Twitter, [recommending only Bitcoin and Monero as long-term investments](https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/950044409332056069).

[There are reports](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/new-digital-currency-spikes-as-drug-dealers-get-more-secrecy-015437551.html) that *"Roger Ver, earlier known as 'Bitcoin Jesus' for his evangelical support of the Bitcoin during its early years, said his investment in Monero is 'substantial' and his biggest in any virtual currency since Bitcoin*.

Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin, has publicly stated his appreciation of Monero. In a September 2017 tweet directed to Edward Snowden explaining why Monero is superior to Zcash, [Charlie Lee tweeted](https://twitter.com/satoshilite/status/913644791144919040):

>All private transactions, More tested privacy tech, No tax on miners to pay investors, No high inflation... better investment.

John McAfee, arguably cryptocurrency's most controversial character at the moment, has publicly supported Monero numerous times over the last twelve months(before he started shilling ICOs), and has even [claimed it will overtake Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c331by6vFz4).

Playboy instagram celebrity Dan Bilzerian is a Monero investor, with [15% of his portfolio made up of Monero](https://www.ccn.com/why-dan-bilzerians-diversified-portfolio-of-cryptocurrencies-is-favorable/).

Finally, while he may not be considered a major investor or figurehead, Erik Finman, a young early Bitcoin investor and multimillionaire, recently appeared in a [CNBC Crypto video interview](https://www.facebook.com/cnbccrypto/videos/vb.1501450679938173/1599864910096749/?type=2&theater), explaining why he isn't entirely sold on Bitcoin anymore, and expresses his interest in Monero, stating:

>"Monero is a really good one. Monero is an incredible currency, it's completely private."

There is a common belief that most of the money in cryptocurrency is still chasing the quick pump and dumps, however as the market matures, more money will flow into legitimate projects such as Monero. Monero's organic growth in price is evidence *smart money* is aware of Monero and gradually filtering in.

**The Bitcoin Flaw**

A relatively unknown blogger named *CryptoIzzy* posted three poignant pieces regarding Monero and its place in the world. [The Bitcoin Flaw: Monero Rising](https://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2017/11/the-bitcoin-flaw-monero-rising.html) provides an intellectual comparison of Monero to other cryptocurrencies, and [Valuing Cryptocurrencies: An Approach](https://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2017/12/valuing-cryptocurrencies-approach.html) outlines methods of valuing different coins. 

CryptoIzzy's most recent blog published only yesterday titled [Monero Valuation - Update and Refocus](https://cryptoizzy.blogspot.com.au/2018/01/monero-valuation-update-and-refocus.html) is a highly recommended read. It touches on why Monero is much more than just a coin for the Darknet Markets, and provides a calculated future price of Monero.

CryptoIzzy also published [The Power of Money: A Case for Bitcoin](https://www.scribd.com/document/360363481/The-Power-of-Money-A-Case-for-Bitcoin), which is an exploration of our monetary system,  and the impact decentralised cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monero will have on the world. In the epilogue the author also provides a positive and detailed future valuation based on empirical evidence. CryptoIzzy predicts Monero to easily progress well into the *four figure* range.

**Monero Has a Relatively Small Marketcap** 

Recently we have witnessed many newcomers to cryptocurrency neglecting to take into account coins' marketcap and circulating supply, blindly throwing money at coins under $5 with inflated marketcaps and large circulating supplies, and then believing it's possible for them to reach $100 because someone posted about it on Facebook or Reddit.

Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Monero still has a *low marketcap*, which means there is great potential for the price to multiply. At the time of writing, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/), Monero's marketcap is only a little over $5 billion, with a circulating supply of 15.6 million Monero, at a price of $322 per coin. 

For this reason, I would argue that this is evidence Monero is grossly undervalued. *Just* a few billion dollars of new money invested in Monero can cause significant price increases. Monero's marketcap only needs to increase to ~$16 billion and the price will triple to over $1000. If Monero's marketcap simply reached ~$35 billion (just over half of Ripple's $55 billion marketcap), Monero's price will increase 600% to over $2000 per coin. 

Another way of looking at this is Monero's marketcap only requires ~$30 billion of new investor money to see the price per Monero reach $2000, while for Ethereum to reach $2000, Ethereum's marketcap requires a whopping ~$100 billion of new investor money.

**Technical Analysis** 

There are numerous Monero technical analysts, however none more eerily on point than the crowd-pleasing Ero23. Ero23's charts and analysis can be found [on Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com/u/Ero23/). Ero23 gained notoriety for his long-term Bitcoin bull chart published in February, which is still in play today. Head over to his Trading View page to see his chart: [*Monero's dwindling supply. $10k in 2019 scenario*](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XMRUSD/89VEffxW-Monero-s-dwindling-supply-10k-in-2019-scenario/), in which Ero23 predicts Monero to reach $10,000 in 2019. There is also [this chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XMRBTC/JsUOgzrQ-Monero-btc-A-New-Hope-current-price-0-0159btc/) which appears to be freakishly accurate and is tracking along perfectly today.

**Coinbase Rumours** 

Over the past 12 months there have been ongoing rumours that Monero will be one of the next cryptocurrencies to be added to Coinbase. In January 2017, Monero Core team member Riccardo 'Fluffypony' Spagni presented a talk at Coinbase HQ. In addition, in November 2017 GDAX announced the *GDAX Digit Asset Framework* outlining specific parameters cryptocurrencies must meet in order to be added to the exchange. There is speculation that when Monero has numerous mobile and hardware wallets available, and multisig is working, then it will be added. This would enable public accessibility to Monero to increase dramatically as [Coinbase had in excess of 13 million users as of December]( https://futurism.com/coinbase-users-surpasses-charles-schwab-brokerage-accounts/), and is only going to grow as demand for cryptocurrencies increases. Many users argue that due to KYC/AML regulations, Coinbase will never be able to add Monero, however the Kraken exchange already operates in the US and has XMR/fiat pairs, so this is unlikely to be the reason Coinbase is yet to implement XMR/fiat trading. 

**Monero Is Not an ICO Scam** 

It is likely most of the ICOs which newcomers invest in, hoping to get rich quick, won't even be in the Top 100 cryptocurrencies next year. A large portion are most likely to be pumps and dumps, and [we have already seen numerous instances of ICO exit scams](https://cointelegraph.com/news/confido-ico-raises-340k-vanishes). Once an ICO raises millions of dollars, the developers or CEO of the company have little incentive to bother rolling out their product or service when they can just cash out and leave. The majority of people who create a company to provide a service or product, do so in order to generate wealth. Unless these developers and CEOs are committed and believed in their product or service, it's likely that the funds raised during the ICO will far exceed any revenue generated from real world use cases.

**Monero is a Working Currency, Today** 

Monero is a working currency, here today.

The  majority of so called cryptocurrencies that exist today are not true currencies, and do not aim to be. They are a token of exchange. They are like a share in a start-up company hoping to use blockchain technology to succeed in business. A *crypto-assest* is a more accurate name for coins such as Ethereum, Neo, Cardano, Vechain, etc.

Monero isn't just a vaporware ICO token that promises to provide a blockchain service in the future. It is not a platform for apps. It is not a pump and dump coin. 

Monero is the only coin with all the necessary properties to be called true money. 

*Monero is private internet money*. 

Some even describe Monero as an online Swiss Bank Account or Bitcoin 2.0, and it is here to continue on from Bitcoin's legacy. 

Monero is alleviating the public from the grips of banks, and protests the monetary system forced upon us.

Monero only achieved this because it is the heart and soul, and blood, sweat, and tears of the contributors to this project. Monero supporters are passionate, and Monero has gotten to where it is today thanks to its contributors and users. 




##**///Key Issues for Monero to Overcome///**

**Scalability** 

While Bulletproofs are soon to be implemented in order to improve Monero's transaction sizes and fees, scalability is an issue for Monero that is continuously being assessed by Monero's researchers and developers to find the most appropriate solution. [Ricardo 'Fluffypony' Spagni recently appeared on CNBC's Crypto Trader]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pwu4g/no_fluffypony_monero_scales_better_than_bitcoin/), and when asked whether Monero is scalable as it stands today, Spagni stated that presently, Monero's on-chain scaling is horrible and transactions are larger than Bitcoin's (because of Monero's privacy features), so side-chain scaling may be more efficient. Spagni elaborated that the Monero team is, and will always be, looking for solutions to an array of different on-chain and off-chain scaling options, such as developing a Mimblewimble side-chain, exploring the possibility of Lightning Network so atomic swaps can be performed, and Tumblebit.

[In a post on the Monero subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7kdjg2/a_small_note_on_secondlayer_stuff_eg_sidechains/) from roughly a month ago, r/monero moderator u/dEBRUYNE_1 supports Spagni's statements. dEBRUYNE_1 clarifies the issue of scalability:

>"In Bitcoin, the main chain is constrained and fees are ludicrous. This results in users being pushed to second layer stuff (e.g. sidechains, lightning network). Users do not have optionality in Bitcoin. In Monero, the goal is to make the main-chain accessible to everyone by keeping fees reasonable. We want users to have optionality, i.e., let them choose whether they'd like to use the main chain or second layer stuff. We don't want to take that optionality away from them."

When the Spagni CNBC video was recently [linked to the Monero subreddit]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pwu4g/no_fluffypony_monero_scales_better_than_bitcoin/), it was met with lengthy debate and discussion from both users and developers. u/ferretinjapan summarised the issue explaining: 

>"Monero has all the mechanisms it needs to find the balance between transaction load, and offsetting the costs of miner infrastructure/profits, while making sure the network is useful for users. But like the interviewer said, the question is directed at "right now", and Fluffys right to a certain extent, Monero's transactions are huge, and compromises in blockchain security will help facilitate less burdensome transactional activity in the future. But to compare Monero to Bitcoin's transaction sizes is somewhat silly as Bitcoin is nowhere near as useful as monero, and utility will facilitate infrastructure building that may eventually utterly dwarf Bitcoin. And to equate scaling based on a node being run on a desktop being the only option for what classifies as "scalable" is also an incredibly narrow interpretation of the network being able to scale, or not. Given the extremely narrow definition of scaling people love to (incorrectly) use, I consider that a pretty crap question to put to Fluffy in the first place, but... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

u/xmrusher also contributed to the discussion, comparing Bitcoin to Monero using this analogous description: 

>"While John is much heavier than Henry, he's still able to run faster, because, unlike Henry, he didn't chop off his own legs just so the local wheelchair manufacturer can make money. While Morono has much larger transactions then Bitcoin, it still scales better, because, unlike Bitcoin, it hasn't limited itself to a cripplingly tiny blocksize just to allow Blockstream to make money."

**Setting up a wallet can still be time consuming** 

It's time consuming and can be somewhat difficult for new cryptocurrency users to set up their own wallet using the GUI wallet or the Command Line Wallet. In order to strengthen and further decentralize the Monero network, users are encouraged to run a full node for their wallet, however this can be an issue because it can take up to 24-48 hours for some users depending on their hard-drive and internet speeds. To mitigate this issue, users can run a remote node, meaning they can remotely connect their wallet to another node in order to perform transactions, and in the meantime continue to sync the daemon so in the future they can then use their own node. 

For users that do run into wallet setup issues, or any other problems for that matter, there is [an extremely helpful troubleshooting thread on the Monero subreddit which can be found here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7hhgjx/monero_gui_01110_helium_hydra_megathread_download/). And not only that, unlike some other cryptocurrency subreddits, if you ask a question, there is always a friendly community member who will happily assist you. [Monero.how]( https://www.monero.how/) is a fantastic resource too!

Despite still being difficult to use, the user-base and price may increase dramatically once it is easier to use. In addition, others believe that when hardware wallets are available more users will shift to Monero. 




##**///Conclusion///**

I actually still feel a little shameful for promoting Monero here, but feel a sense of duty to do so. 

Monero is transitioning into an unstoppable altruistic beast. This year offers the implementation of many great developments, accompanied by the likelihood of a dramatic increase in price.

I request you discuss this post, point out any errors I have made, or any information I may have neglected to include. Also, if you believe in the Monero project, I encourage you to join your local Facebook or Reddit cryptocurrency group and spread the word of Monero. You could even link this post there to bring awareness to new cryptocurrency users and investors.

I will leave you with an old on-going joke within the Monero community - *Don't buy Monero* - unless you have a use case for it of course :-)  Just think to yourself though - Do I have a use case for Monero in our unpredictable Huxleyan society? Hint: The answer is ? 

*Edit: Added in the Tail Emission section, and noted Dan Bilzerian as a Monero investor. Also added information regarding the XMR.TO payment service. Added info about hardfork*
Coinmarketcap several minutes after the dump (peaked around -78%): [https://imgur.com/a/MbnSLZV](https://imgur.com/a/MbnSLZV)

I tried to warn everyone two days ago. But now here we are, it's too late, the team has cashed out.

Most of you saw my recent post here about all the red flags of the recent Apollo cryptocurrency - the way they censored their social channels/Telegram, how they encouraged their members to stock up and and BUY and banned anyone who talked about selling instantly. How they actively pumped up the price of their coin the past couple of weeks through fake news and shill armies.

That's not why we're here.

I was just online when I notice a sell order on the APL exchange. Wait not just one sell order. Many. And then I went to the other APL exchanges. Same situation. Suddenly hundreds of millions of APL were hitting all exchanges all at once in a massive dump that sent the price shooting down over 70%.

I immediately went to the block explorer. The Apollo block explorer features no rich lists for obvious reasons, so I knew I had limited time to find the dev’s accounts and their transactions that would cause the dump in the history. Low and behold, I found a couple of them: [https://imgur.com/a/vXi2GXE](https://imgur.com/a/vXi2GXE)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8638689226260340876](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8638689226260340876)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/4357878630730037753](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/4357878630730037753)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8981386827427737067](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/8981386827427737067)

[https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/285778997163958679](https://explorer.apollowallet.org/accounts/285778997163958679)

I didn't continue to go back in time on the block explorer, but you all know where to go look if you want to find the team's accounts now for this "anonymous" currency. I checked the balances on several of those accounts and some had around a billion APL, with the others having hundreds of million. The only people who own anywhere near this much are the Apollo team (and possibly John McAfee, lol).

I will continue to edit this and add information but want to get it out there now while this is happening so people can start discussing it in here.

Previous post from 2 days ago if you want to catch up on what's been going on up until this point: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ai5b62/apollo\_apl\_is\_a\_massive\_scam\_and\_you\_are\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ai5b62/apollo_apl_is_a_massive_scam_and_you_are_all/)

*(My last post was removed by the automod for having the word "Mega-thread" in the title. I'll repost everything here so people are aware of what's happening and continue to provide updates.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Updates

**7:10 AM update**: APL Telegram Channel put on read-only mode for 10 minutes

**7:25 AM update**: Re-enabled, the admins are now threatening to mute anyone who mentions anything about the dump and encouraging people to "buy cheap": [https://imgur.com/a/xyptHBp](https://imgur.com/a/xyptHBp)

**8:05 AM update**: They are BANNING everyone from the telegram who tries to talk about the situation in a negative light, asks a question about what happened, or tries to ask any of these questions over PM to another member: [https://imgur.com/a/kWx3ULe](https://imgur.com/a/kWx3ULe)

**8:07 PM update:** Bitmart's entire exchange has went completely offline as well (the main exchange for trading APL). APL is now only actively trading on Coinbene. To Check Statuses: [Link to Bitmart](https://www.bitmart.com/trade?symbol=APL_BTC). [Link to Coinbene.](https://www.coinbene.com/exchange.html#/exchange?pairId=APLETH)

**9:10 AM update:** APL Telegram is saying everyone is buying APL on Coinbene (only active APL exchange left right now) to get back in. However, every one of these "buy" trades is actually just a wash trade and never actually appears on the exchange - it's conducted between the highest bid and lowest ask. You can watch the order book for 30 seconds and look at the prices of the last "buy orders" to confirm that this is wash trading.

**9:14 AM update:** The APL founder Steve McCullah is finally in the Telegram, he has not acknowledged the situation yet and has said "everything is great": [https://imgur.com/a/idnE6wH](https://imgur.com/a/idnE6wH)

**9:18 AM update:** Steve confirms everything will be fine and includes rocket ship emoji's in his post to ensure his loyal telegram followers that this coin is still going to the moon: [https://imgur.com/a/BkjA0MA](https://imgur.com/a/BkjA0MA)

**9:35 AM update:** I'm seriously having issues not typing anything in the Telegram so I can continue to provide updates. It's getting tough watching Steve continue to ignore the situation, using rocket ship emoji's, and acting like everything is just perfect after (allegedly) dumping a ton of coins earlier this morning on investors. All opposition or people speaking out in the group have already been banned and messaging has slowed down a lot. Steve is telling people not to worry about anything as there will be a big announcement today or tomorrow: [https://imgur.com/a/NKFTkM3](https://imgur.com/a/NKFTkM3)

**9:53 PM update:** Steve is has just continuing on with the "everything is fine" narrative and not acknowledging anything.

**9:55 PM update:** I just want to make people aware that this could be happening but by no means definitely is (this is theory, not fact, but should be considered given the situation):

MASSIVE buying up of all the sell orders just appeared in the order books on Bitmart, the main exchange for APL and the place where Steve or the team deposited the majority of their APL: [https://imgur.com/a/LrhNnQn](https://imgur.com/a/LrhNnQn)

Steve starts talking about the APL price and how it's going back up again RIGHT as these buys happened: [https://imgur.com/a/gobtQUf](https://imgur.com/a/gobtQUf)

It seems very obvious to anyone watching the Telegram that he is trying to cover his tracks by buying up back to a reasonable price so the price of APL dropping 78% in 1 minute earlier doesn't seem apparent. Like I said, it's what it looked like but there's no way to confirm that's actually what just happened.
Yesterday, after I made a popular post on here, a user sent me a chat request:

"I'm writing to enquire as to whether you would we interested in helping me grow our reddit audience interested we could put an offer on the table?" (sic!)

As always with scams, I answered and of course was very interested in the offer. So I got some more info, let's play bullshit bingo what their "platform" plans to do:

* they use your phone's CPU for mining
* the CPU is used to power scientific research
* each transaction gives a small % to charity
* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees
* "our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place", so it's officially a pyramid scheme
* the token will launch soon ™

Two months ago, the same guy that sent me the chat [posted to some sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) (I just sent him this post so he might delete this, [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) it's archived), pretending to have just stumbled upon this project. They offered me 10 USDT for making a shill post, they would upvote it to make it more visible and if things go well I would get "weekly crypto sum of our tokens plus your own  and also USDT to incentivize good work".

Of course I would never do that, and I doubt they would pay. But some people might have no morals and take their offer. So if you ever see someone shilling OpisHub (they seem really bad at promoting their scam, so maybe you won't), just know: it's a pyramid scheme, the posts are paid and absolutely everything points to it being a scam. Just avoid it and call them out on it.
I sure do love cryptocurrency.  I also enjoy interacting with other people who enjoy it, and even if we disagree it’s fun to debate and learn.  
  
What I don’t enjoy is when a company hires someone to write a 3000 word shill post, and then they upvote it and mass comment on it using their hundreds of sock puppet accounts.  
  
What’s even worse is when you try to call out this behavior, they then use those hundreds of sock puppet accounts to bury you in downvotes and reply to each other’s comments all patting each other on the ass.  
  
It’s fake as fuck, cringe, and does nothing but try to enrich some asshole.  If you see any slick topic in this subreddit with a bunch of shallow comments all cheering each other on, please downvote the shit out of it and call it for what it is.  
  
The problem is far too vast during the bull market; I guess we have to accept that sort of thing is allowed.  But now?  During the great bear?  This is our one moment of peace and respite.  
  
Let us have it.  Fuck off shills.
Yes, you read that title right. I'm going to share with you what it takes to become wealthy using just the top two large cap crypto. This might seem absurd compared to the 100x magic bullet micro cap coins that everyone else digs up.

*Niceee. Finally someone made a go to guide that is gonna get us lambos.*

Uhh.. Not quite. You see lets define **WEALTHY** and see how it is different from the word **Rich.**

[Ahem, yeah we know how to google and english man, stop messing with us](https://preview.redd.it/wn29xvvhby581.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab43c368bc99f3dd9f45989916807acf1447b52d)

https://preview.redd.it/4eru9i3lby581.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c2f48561a493b41eedf851f2ec68842a44a6070

Alright lets just compare rich versus wealthy. Then you might be enlightened:

[Assorted collection of article headings from countless websites explaining the difference](https://preview.redd.it/8pf36i0lcy581.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=06e5a1dc9c41362b7bd71f4bf58d2a349a273225)

Basically, the **rich have a large sum of money while the wealthy are able to generate enough money to always be rich.**

My goal with this method of investment is to ensure that following it, we end up with enough investment that we are able to generate wealth passively that is enough to aid or even sustain living comfortably.

*Okay... Spill the beans, what do we need to do ?*

This stratergy requires you to put in three things:

1. Time
2. Money
3. Effort and Perseverance

*-ROLLS EYES- Yeah if we had money to throw around we would have been rich in the first place. What troll is this ?*

Not quite. What I am proposing is a simple yet effective stratergy that we have heard a bazillion times on this subreddit. And that is **DCA !!!**

*Oh F Off man, downvote, report. Ban this guy from this sub*

Wait wait, let me explain it in detail. This is worth your time.

Consider getting a 10 percent average year on year growth in the price of an asset. This means if it costs 100$ to buy today, then next year it will cost 110$, and the year after that it will cost 121$ and so on. So what we are going to do is invest in a periodic manner into this asset so that over the course of multiple years our investments grows substantially. How substantially ? It might blow your mind

[Ignore the Indian Rupee, the calculation is independent of the currency and only dependent on the amount](https://preview.redd.it/v14fcuztey581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5aa9599217d1c04e06b1e30eaa4a8e2517667344)

Imagine putting in 500$ a month for the next 10 years

When the 10 years have come, you would have invested i.e spent out of your pocket **60,000$**

But when you are going to cash out, you have over **100,00$** at your disposal. So you have made a profit of **43,000$** which is a 71 percent profit

*Pffftt... 71 percent. Those are rookie numbers.*

But wait a minute, we considered a 10 percent year on year growth right ? That means that if ETH today costs 4000$ then it must cost no more than 4400$ next year to be 10 percent growth.... LOL you think thats the potential of ETH or BTC ? We have seen so much movement within the last few months that over the course of multiple years or a bear and bull cycle, we can easily have a positive outlook. Thats the beauty of this method. Lets just put in a quick 15 percent optimistic rise. A little dirty mind math says we can expect to double the price of ETH within 6 or 7 years. Then.....

[Interesting isn't it ?](https://preview.redd.it/wsh0ko0xgy581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6c00d6a2ee71c3f40eeb6da645bca9d0c46f46ea)

Your investment amount for 10 years still is the same at 60,000$ but your profits went from \~43,000$ to \~**80,000$ which is almost doubling.** Again a 15 percent year on year growth might still be conservative. Punching a 20 percent just to see the madness unfold

[Voila](https://preview.redd.it/fysnp63ahy581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c1e0fa13f99ed09b3f6c9a19dea96f939c62ee72)

Your profits are **200 percent of your investment. ie you have tripled the amount of money you have put into crypto.**

Now of course, there is one more thing that I haven't told you guys and that is **step up** in investment as well. Over the course of ten years, it is likely that your fiat paying job will progress and you can afford to invest more as the years go by. This is the "stepping up" of your monthly investment. Lets say for the first 12 months you do 500$ a month and then then next 12 months at 550$ dollars a month which means every year, you are increasing your monthly investment amount by 10 percent. Adding that into the calculation we can have the hopium overdose of...

[2.5X your intial investment by just blindly throwing money at the top 2 crytpo with no other plans or chart looking or anything](https://preview.redd.it/xns4em44iy581.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8649dd664e931364d7414ad3f85953e340dc1cac)

This also ignores other key aspects where you can further increase the returns. Buying ETH means you can stake them for even more returns **BUT those returns are in ETH itself which increases in price. This compounds things so much that I am unable to find an online calculator (LOL)**

So I hope I have convinced you on why DCA or SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a much more easy and much less risky than the concept of just chasing the next micro cap shilling and scams.

BUT, as with the case, there are caveats. My recommendation for ETH and BTC are the follows:

1. BTC is the OG and will always be a part of institutional investment.
2. ETH is the largest platform as a crypto that exists today. Years of development and countless projects have made it the largest to the point where we can safely assume it will be the baseline standard for years to come.
3. Compared to a lot of cyrpto celebrity, Vitalik Buterin, the co founder of ETH is much more of a good person who has a good track record of being on the morally right side. Yes their track record of delivering updates has been sub par to put it mildly. But the team are working hard led by a man who is as much a nerd as we are and I genuinely believe he wants ETH to succeed to make the world a better place.
4. Competition for ETH in the form of other coins have been growing and is ever present. But they also are facing their fair share of troubles and issues. Apart from marketing, nothing can claim to be an ETH killer.

And more importantly about the things that we put in:

1. The MONEY part. Yes there is no beating around the bush with it. Invest what you can. Rather than dreaming of what you could put in, put in what you have right now.
2. The TIME part. Yes this is a long term plan that indeed makes you wealthy. You'll have a decent chunk of money by the end of the SIP that you can use to it buy a house, buy something that makes you happy
3. The EFFORT and PERSEVERANCE part. You need to be patient for this to pay off. Unless you definitely need the money, try sticking to investing the amount you planned. Persevere and it will pay off definitely.

This is just my own 2 cents about how I plan to try and retire in the next 15 years. I wanted to share with you guys to show that it really is possible. Thank you if you read till here and gave this idea a thought. But, if you scrolled till here, then TLDR is **DCA FOR TEN YEARS !!!!!!**

I'll be making a follow up post on what I plan to do when I cash into the DCA. If there is anything I missed or is wrong, let me know in the comments and I'll put those into the post and the next one. Share your thoughts too :)
I'm sure everyone has seen the clip by now. If you haven't Google it. 

USD is the world's reserve currency, china holds over 3T USD alone. USD stabilizes local currencies around the globe. If China decides to cash out their USD for a cryptocurrency. It would crash the USD, US economy and the US would lose it's world power status. This is a very real threat that in my opinion is inevitable

If this scares you I would recommend researching the technology behind crypto and buying the best one. Even a small amount of a crypto that will become the world's new reserve currency will lead to incredible gains. I have my opinion on which crypto I think will succeed but I don't want to be labeled a shill
 The hearing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg731-3id8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg731-3id8) 

**TLDR: Bullish and interesting**

**Question 1 from  Diana Degette to  Ari Juels** 

**Is there a way to do Proof of work without wasting energy or electronic waste?** 

He answers that there is no other way but there is always Proof of Stake (he shills it at every occasion)

**Question 2 (same speakers)** 

**Do people have incentives to go to the cheapest energy to mine?**

Yes but there is always proof of stake (Diana Degette shuts him saying they'll come to that later) 

**Question 3  Diana Degette to  John Belizaire** 

**Why the energy consumption is a feature not a bug?** 

=> The energy consumption is here to protect the network and lock in the value. 

**Question 4 Diana Degette to  Steve Wright** 

**Sometimes Renewable are not the cheapest right?** 

Yes

**Question 5 Diana Degette to  Brian P. Brooks** 

**You mention that proof of work can't shift to proof of stake why?** 

The proof of work makes a big value compared to other industries per consumption of energy. **Proof of Stake poses problems of security because of the holders but proof of work is more resilient and more decentralized**

New Character arrives: David McKinley [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_McKinley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley)

Cries about the hearing being a distraction from real problems. Says that states without renewable are discriminated because of renewable. He is mainly ranting. 

**He asks: could miners rely on renewable to Greg Zerzan** 

Answer: Yes as long as it is cheap and as long as the US is a net exporter of energy.

**Back to  Frank Pallone  who asks: The concern about high power consumption and the future of it to Greg Zerzan** 

Greg Zerzan speaks about data centers using also a lot of data. 

**Frank Pallone asks why the 0.5% of energy consumption is credible to Ari Juels** 

Derived from Hashrate. 

Frank Pallone asks Steve wright how can we make sure consumers don't pay more because of miners. 

The dude lags hardcore and I can't get a grip of what the fuck he said. Seriously this is a US congress hearing and I have a better connection that this dude. (the congressman didn't understand too and asked for a written answer LMAO) 

**Cathy McMorris asks of Zerzan how blockchain can empower the consumer?** 

He explains how it makes people control their data which undercuts Facebook, google and all other Big tech companies. 

**McMorris explains how the job boom of blockchain is outpacing other industries and asks about the value from these jobs?** 

Zerzan explains how cryptos are the blood of the blockchain and that these experts are needed to make the cryptos and blockchain work. 

**Mc Morris asks Steve wright (the laggy boy) what are the negative impacts of crypto mining**

He says his community is scared by unregulated currencies and that they are skeptical about these technologies but doesn't answer the question.

She explains how many assets exist and how the industry is growing and helping the world. She questions the sustainability. She explains that some leaders in the POW are trying their best to be green and to make big projects to develop a better power grid. 

**She asks Brian P. Brooks What are the innovation in the future of the crypto mining?** 

Brooks explains how crypto is not about tax evasion or money laundering, he explains how bitcoin is the most decentralized crypto and that there is value in decentralization. He explains how companies in this space are starting to fight against the giant in tech. 

**He says, decentralization is safer, fairer and the future.** 

**She asks John Bellzaire what are the exiled miners from China searching in the US ?**

He explains that miners who have suffered from 'the great unplugging' have been searching for a free market with a real ecosystem (insurance companies etc) rule of law and are trying to thrive in the larger US economy.

Is very pro crypto, says he accepts crypto campaign donations. He wants to 'let the market decide'. He says that they should help crypto to thrive instead of regulating it. 

He asks Brooks **how halving will help miners who are more efficients and to be more energy efficient?**

Brooks explains that these halving are seen as the next big rise in the crypto sector and are pushing progress in a lot of other sectors such as cooling industries. 

**He asks Brooks how chips technology is benefiting from Bitcoin POW.** 

Brooks explains how they have pushed specialized chip tech forward and that they made leaps comparable to the tech leaps produced by the Space program. 

**He asks brooks if miners in other countries are dirtier, isn't the solution to welcome them in the US?** 

Brooks answers yes.

**Focuses on the old plants re-opened and how economics can push the miners to fossil fuels. (She seems very old)** 

**Asks about that to Steve Wright:** 

He answers that as coal is less and less demanded due to regulation, the prices get lowers and some may be interested in these products. 

Asks John Bellzaire about cleaner sources and says she is skeptical about crypto and about the fact that they use fossil fuel. (she is anti crypto I think but yay) 

John Bellzaire answers that Crypto brings huge capital which help with the transformative of the grid and of the zero carbon footprint. The capital deployed in clean energy is currently virtualy infinite because of subsidies and of crypto capital. 

She says that they should hope Bellzaire's vision comes to fruition

 **Morgan Griffith asks if Southwest Virginia could profit from the fact that it has cold temperatures to Brooks.** 

Brooks says yes. 

**He then asks the same to other people who say all yes**. 

**He voices concern that congress should not regulate the crypto space out of existence and asks Brooks what he thinks about this.** 

Brooks answers that Bitcoin's value is not about the market cap of Bitcoin but about the transactions and about the fact that Bitcoin is the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. So Bitcoin should be protected. 

**He asks Zerzan if China ban on crypto shows an anti freedom stance.** 

Zerzan says that crypto is freedom and some people don't like freedom.

Says that a lot of miners are interested in the energy in New York. **Asks Bellzaire if it is possible to ban crypto miners from fossil fuel?** 

Bellzaire explains that this could be feasible through carbon tax credits or financial incentives to develop flexible load environement. 

And that they could also incentive Green energy producer to team up with miners. 

**He then Asks Juels if consuming excess energy from renewable has opportunity cost**

Juels answers by saying that he needs to repair something that was said: Mining rigs are more efficient over time but it doesn't mean that the energy infused has been reduced. And doesn't answer. 

**The law maker ask again why he believes that this excess energy is wasted when used on POW?**

Juels answers that **it is because proof of stake exist and that the concerns about the centralization of POS are very theoretical. For him it is not proven yet that the validators could break it. He says that this energy could go else where gives a very bad answer.**

New character: Scott Peters [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott\_Peters\_(politician)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Peters_(politician)) 

**Asks to Brooks is it possible to reduce consumption with better equipment?** 

Brooks says that yes, in fact the energy efficiency of energy/ hash has improved dramatically and that the industries benefiting from Asic have gained a lot thanks to the funding in R&D funding from miners. 

**Asks to Juels why he says that it is in fact not reducing consumption or being more efficient.** 

Juels explains that he doesn't measure energy consumption / hash but per transaction and in that sense Bitcoin is very energy intensive. He also says that the lightening network is not used a lot and in its infancy and remains to be seen how succesful it is. (lol talks about millions of people using it daily...) 

**Asks to Bellzaire how his vision of flexibility translate in application.**

Bellzaire answers that these datacenters decentralized could help with algorithms and other problems not only POW but bringing valuable applications.

**The law maker kim schrier is saying: Do you think that despite the ransomware, the drug and human traffics, are crypto really bringing value to humanity? (what a moron)** 

Steve Wrights says it depends, and it depends on regulations, **he wants a mechanism to be sure crypto is not used in the wrong way (decentralization is not about this).**

**Directly asks Brooks if the number of miners is important.** 

Brooks answers that it is not that important **at least less than in proof of stake** since POW can't be tricked and the lottery makes collusion impossible but **proof of stake allows for collusion and modification of blockchain.** 

**She Asks Juels about proof of stake consolidation and is it a real alternative to POW.** 

Juels says that the concern is not about POS or POW but about centralization and that POW is not better in that front. Juels says that the real concern is about the rich being richer but that most problems are unrelated to POS or POW. (He is cheerleading for POS) 

**Asks juels what is the danger of centralization** 

Juels explains that the problem would be an overtake of the blockchain and a control of the transactions.

Wright answers that data centers were better prepared to approach the energy industry and that Bitcoin miners were unprepared

**The lawmaker asks what growth in jobs is made in these industries**

Bellzaire answers that the jobs produced per energy is not known by him BUT that they are creating high value jobs such as data technicians and that the value is high.

&#x200B;

Says that Crypto is very mystifying and that Crypto can be a future, a currency, a commodity, and a security. This committee is the first to have passed bills to establish these kind of definitions and also taxation rules. He wants to make sure that Crypto is not used by terrorist and wants way to claw back some of the money. 

Says he is concerned with the energy use and how coal plants are re-opened because of Bitcoin. He says that, if crypto is the currency of the future, we can't destroy the planet to make it work. 

**Asks Juels how Data oracles can make blockchain more efficient?** 

Juels says that oracles are not making these more efficient it is not their role. He says that Smart Contracts are actually at the core of this. He says that blockchain are not connected to internet and that the oracle is the link between blockchain and offchain systems. 'the eyes and ears of smart contracts' 

**Asks Brooks what the gov should do to encourage less energy intensive efforts?** 

Brooks answers that the market is the best answer, it depends on a lot of costs and Bitcoin is an energy derivative which can be used to understand the best role of energy at a current time. 

**Brooks also says that his companies are talking to wind farms and solar farms, not coal plants. The anecdotal stories of coal plants are not the reality. The vast majority of Bitcoin miners are providing a base load consumption to Green energy producers.**

The thing concludes with Degette saying that they are happy with answers today and want to know how in the future if miners are located in the US how will the energy spending evolve. 

She says that the testimonies were of the utmost value today.

***

*Disclaimer: I am not and have never been affiliated with any of the mentioned parties in a private or professional matter.*

Presumably in an attempt to smear a local competitor, Hayden Otto inadvertently publishes irrefutable on-chain proof that he excluded non-BCH retail revenue to shape the "BCH #1 in Australia" narrative.


- Scroll down to **"Proof of exclusion"** if you are tired of the drama recap.
- Scroll down to **"TLDR"** if you want a summary.

****

## Recap
In September 2019, BitcoinBCH.com started publishing so called monthly "reports" about crypto retail payments in Australia. They claimed that **~90% of Australia's crypto retail revenue is processed via their own HULA system** and that **~92% of all crypto retail revenue happens in BCH**.

They are aggregating two data sources to come up with this claim.

One is **TravelByBit (TBB)** who *publishes* their PoS transactions (BTC, LN, ETH, BNB, DASH, BCH) live on a [ticker](https://travelbybit.com/stats).

The other source is **HULA**, a newly introduced POS system (BCH only) and direct competitor to TBB run by BitcoinBCH.com - the same company who created the report. Despite being on-chain their transactions are *private*, not published and not verifiable by third parties outside BitcoinBCH.com

Two things stood out in the "reports", noted by multiple users (including vocal BCH proponents):

- **The non-BCH parts must have tx excluded and the report neglects to mention it** (the total in their TBB analysis does not match what is reported on the TBB website.)
- **The BCH part has outliers included** (e.g. BCH city conference in September with 35x the daily average)

The TBB website loads the historic tx data in the browser but hides transactions older than 7 days from being displayed, i.e. you can access more than 7 days worth of data if you understand JavaScript and can read the source code ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4mnfas/)).


## Hayden Otto's reaction

In direct response to me publishing these findings on r/btc, Hayden Otto - an employee at BitcoinBCH.com and the author of the report who also happens to be a moderator of /r/BitcoinCash - banned me immediately from said sub ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dincg5/ucryptostrategies_banned_me_from_rbitcoincash_for/)).

In subsequent discussion (which repeated for every monthly "report" which was flawed in the same ways as described above), Hayden responded using the same tactics:

***

**"No data was removed"**

> "The guy is straight out lying. There is guaranteed no missing tx as the data was collected directly from the source." ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/ds0967/october_report_for_australian_crypto_expenditure/f6nldiy/))

****

**"Only data I considered non-retail was removed"**

> "I also had these data points and went through them to remove non-retail transactions, on both TravelbyBit and HULA." ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dibzek/crypto_payments_not_adding_up_for_australia_and/f3vu2dh/))

He admits to have removed non-BCH tx by "Game Ranger" because he considers them non-retail ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8z3ox/)). He also implies they might be involved in money laundering and that TBB might fail their AML obligations in processing Game Ranger's transactions ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8vclc/)).

The report does not mention any data being excluded at all and he still fails to explain why several businesses that are clearly retail (e.g. restaurants, cafes, markets) had tx excluded ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dqfcmz/bitcoin_cash_bch_outspent_bitcoin_core_btc_by_a/f65izlk/)).

****

**"You are too late to prove I altered the data"**

> "[...] I recorded [the data] manually from https://travelbybit.com/stats/ over the month of September. The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**" ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/))

Fortunately you can, if you can read the website's source code. But you need to know a bit of JavaScript to verify it yourself, so not an ideal method to easily prove the claim of data exclusion to the public. But it laters turns out Hayden himself has found an easier way to achieve the same.

***

**"The report can't be wrong because it has been audited."**

In response to criticism about the flawed methodology in generating the September report, BitcoinBCH.com hired an accountant from a regional Bitcoin BCH startup to "audit" the October report. This is remarkable, because not only did their reported TBB totals still not match those from the TBB site - their result was mathematically impossible. How so? No subset of TBB transaction in that month sums up to the total they reported. So even if they excluded retail transactions at will, they still must have messed up the sum ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/ds11om/the_markets_have_yet_to_pricein_bitcoin_cashs/f6mui0q/)). Why didn't their auditor notice their mistake? She said she "conducted a review based on the TravelByBit data **provided to her**", i.e. the data acquisition and selection process was **explicitly excluded from the audit** ([source](https://bitcoinbch.com/assets/img/blog/october-report/october2019audit.pdf)).

***
**"You are a 'pathetic liar', a 'desperate toll', an 'astroturf account' and 'a total dumb ass' and are 'pulling numbers out of your ass!'"**


Since he has already banned me from the sub he moderates, he started to resort to ad hominems ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dqfcmz/bitcoin_cash_bch_outspent_bitcoin_core_btc_by_a/f68ppam/), [source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8pbgh/), [source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8vclc/), [source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8zaca/)).

## Proof of exclusion

I published raw data as extracted from the TBB site after each report for comparison. Hayden responded that I made those numbers up and that I [was pulling numbers out of my ass](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8zaca/).

Since he was under the impression that

> "The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**" ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/))

he felt confident to claim that I would be

> unable to provide a source for the [missing] data and/or **prove that that data was not already included in the report**. ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4j4o6z/))

Luckily for us Hayden Otto seems to dislike his competitor TravelByBit so much that he attempted to reframe Bitcoin's RBF feature as a vulnerability specific to TBB PoS system ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/ecdze0/at_this_very_moment_you_can_go_and_double_spend/)).

While doublespending a merchant using the TBB PoS he wanted to prove that the merchant successfully registered the purchase as complete and thus exposed that **the PoS sales history of TBB's merchants are available to the public** ([source](https://youtu.be/lLkiu8zs318?t=329)), in his own words:

> "You can literally access it from a public URL in the Web browser. There is no login or anything required, just type in the name of the merchant." ([source](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/eeqx9n/australia_travelbybit_crypto_pos_provider_is/fbwd0tn/))

As of yet it is unclear if this is intentional by TBB or if Hayden Ottos followed the rules of responsible disclosure before publishing this kind of data leak.

As it happens, those sale histories do not only include the merchant and time of purchases, they **even include the address the funds were sent to (in case of on-chain payments)**.

This gives us an easy method to prove that the purchases from the TBB website missing in the reports belong to a specific retail business and actually happened - something that is impossible to prove for the alleged HULA txs.

In order to make it easier for you to verify it yourself, we'll focus on a single day in the dataset, **September 17th, 2019** as an example:

- Hayden Otto's report claims **20 tx and $713.00** in total for that day ([source](https://bitcoinbch.com/blog/Australian-Cryptocurrency-Expenditure-at-Retail-Businesses.html))
- The TBB website listed **40 tx and a total of $1032.90** ([daily summary](https://ceddit.com/r/btc/comments/dibzek/crypto_payments_not_adding_up_for_australia_and/f3x07i2/))
- Pick a merchant, e.g. "The Stand Desserts"
- Use Hayden's "trick" to access that merchants public sale history at https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/merchanthistory/thestanddesserts, sort by date to find the 17th Sep 2019 and look for a transaction at 20:58 for $28. This proves that a purchase of said amount is associated with this specific retail business.
- Paste the associated crypto on-chain address  `17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9` in a blockchain explorer of your choice, e.g like [this](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9). This proves that a transfer of funds has actually happened.

I let software aggregate the TBB statistics with the public sale histories and you'll find at the bottom of this post a table with the on-chain addresses conveniently linked to blockchain explorers for our example date.

The total of **all 40 tx is $1032.90** instead of the $713.00 reported by Hayden. 17 tx of those have a corresponding on-chain address and thus have undeniable proof of $758.10. Of the remaining 23, 22 are on Lightning and one had no merchant history available.

This is just for a single day, here is a comparison for the whole month.

| Description | Total |
| - | - |
| TBB Total | $10,502|
| TBB wo. Game Ranger|$5,407|
| TBB according to Hayden|$3,737|

## What now?

The usual shills will respond in a predictive manner: The data must be fake even though its proof is on-chain, I would need to provide more data but HULA can be trusted without any proof, if you include outliers BCH comes out ahead, yada, yada.

But this is not important. I am not here to convince them and this post doesn't aim to.

The tx numbers we are talking about are less than 0.005% of Bitcoin's global volume. If you can increase adoption in your area by 100% by just buying 2 coffees more per day you get a rough idea about how irrelevant the numbers are in comparison.

What is relevant though and what this post aims to highlight is that BitcoinBCH.com and the media outlets around news.bitcoin.com flooding you with the BCH #1 narrative are playing dirty. They feel justified because they feel that Bitcoin/Core/Blockstream is playing dirty as well. I am not here to judge that but you as a reader of this sub should be aware that this is happening and that you are the target.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes $1,000 Bitcoin tx because of high value but includes $15,000 BCH tx because they are made by "professionals", you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes game developers, travel businesses or craftsmen accepting Bitcoin because they don't have a physical store but include a lawyer practice accepting BCH, you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes restaurants, bars and supermarkets accepting Bitcoin and when pressed reiterate that they excluded **non-retail** businesses without ever explaning why a restaurant shouldn't be considered reatil, you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com claims the reports have been audited but omit that the data acquisition was not part of the audit, you should be sceptical.

I expect that BitcoinBCH.com will stop removing transactions from TBB for their reports now that it has been shown that their exclusion can be provably uncovered. I also expect that HULA's BCH numbers will rise accordingly to maintain a similar difference.

Hayden Otto assumed that nobody could cross-check the TBB data. He was wrong. Nobody will be able to disprove his claims when HULA's BCH numbers rise as he continues to refuse their release. You should treat his claims accordingly.

As usual, do your own research and draw your own conclusion. Sorry for the long read.

## TLDR

- BitcoinBCH.com claimed no transactions were removed from the TBB dataset in their BCH #1 reports and that is impossible to prove the opposite.
- Hayden Otto's reveals in a double spend attempt that a TBB merchant's sale history can be accessed publicly including the merchant's on-chain addresses.
- (For example,) this table shows 40 tx listed on the TBB site on Sep 17th, including their on-chain addresses where applicable. The BitcoinBCH.com report lists only 20 tx for the same day.
- (Most days and **every** months so far has had BTC transactions excluded.)
- (For September, TBB lists $10,502 yet the report only claims $3,737.
