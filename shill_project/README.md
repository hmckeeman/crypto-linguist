I did a deep dive into the word ´shill´ to see if I could find anything cool about its use and meaning! I was presently surprised!

A couple things to note - YOU NEED TO USE YOUR OWNER PRAW KEYS! 

Furthermore, data_cleanup.py only collects the sentence with the word ´shill´ from the reddit post (reddit posts can be really long!). This was done using punction marks and presumes that redditors have proper grammar (they don´t and I think that is really interesting!)

Lastly, NTLK offers a really great set of Part of Speech Tags(POS) but they were a little too in depth for this small project. Included the code the the POS_tagger but I manually labeled the data.
