#  **Crypto-Linguist** 8-)
## This repository leverages basic coding and databases in order to explore the ever changing language of the cryptorealm/cryptosphere/cryptoverse!

___
___
## This repository takes the perspective of a descriptivist (a linguist who is interested in **how people acutally use langauge** - not how they should use language)

#### **Sorry but there are rules**:
**1.)** Anyone can contribute or comment - but be exceedingly kind to each other!

**2.)** As Descriptivists we report on actual language - which sometimes may be inappropriate. Please do so with maturity and without opinion (we are a-political).

**3.)** Have fun and be creative - but please, not at the expense of others and always give credit where it is due!

## The Importance of Privacy
Keeping in line with crypto values: **KEEP ALL OF YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION AS EXACTLY THAT - PRIVATE!!!** 

We do not want to know your API keys, seed phrase, or anything like that!!

## Example Code

If you are using an API, say PRAW from Reddit for example - create a  `config.ini` file like the one below:



    
    [reddit]
    client_id = YOUR PRIVATE ID
    client_secret = YOUR SECRET ID
    user_agent = script by u/YOUR USERNAME 
    username = YOUR USERNAME
    password = YOUR PASSWORD


Then add it to your .gitignore file!
After use `configparser` in your code base to keep it a secret :) (you can find an example of this in the shill_project folder)

# LASTLY 
Keep your data and code as clean as possible and leave an abundance of comments so we can help all levels of programmers! **THANKS!**
